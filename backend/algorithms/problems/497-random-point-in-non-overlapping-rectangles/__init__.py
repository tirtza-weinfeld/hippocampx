Title: Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles
Definition: Given non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles `rectangles[i]=[x1,y1,x2,y2]`, \
    where `(x1,y1)` is the bottom-left and `(x2,y2)` the top-right corner (integer coordinates, inclusive).
    Implement a class Solution(rectangles) and a method `pick()` \
    such that each integer point inside the union of all rectangles is chosen with equal probability.
