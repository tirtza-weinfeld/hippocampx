Definition: Given a stick of length n and cut positions, each cut costs the stick's current length.\
    Find the minimum total cost to make all cuts 
    + `[7!]2 <= n <= 10^6` , `[7!]1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)` , `[7!]1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
    + *[8!]All the integers in cuts array are distinct*
