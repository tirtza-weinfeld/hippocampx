    Intuition:
        Flatten the Board First ðŸŽ²
        The key insight here is to **pre-process the 2D `board` into a 1D `flat_board` list**. This powerful first step handles all the complex Boustrophedonical logic upfront. By doing this, the BFS loop becomes exceptionally clean and avoids the need for a coordinate conversion function. The search can then operate on a simple 1D array, treating the board as the simple, linear graph it truly represents.

    Time Complexity:
        O(n^2)
        where n is the dimension of the board. The initial flattening of the board takes O(n^2) time. The subsequent BFS visits each of the n^2 squares at most once.
