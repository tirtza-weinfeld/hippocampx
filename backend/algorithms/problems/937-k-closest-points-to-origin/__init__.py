Title: K Closest Points to Origin
Definition: Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$).
    You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
