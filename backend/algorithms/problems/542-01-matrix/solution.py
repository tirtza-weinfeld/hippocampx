    Intuition:
        Multi-Source BFS from the Target ðŸŽ¯:
        Instead of starting a separate BFS from every `1` to find the nearest `0` (which would be slow), this approach inverts the problem. It starts a single, **multi-source BFS from all `0`s simultaneously**. The level of the BFS at which a cell is reached is, by definition, its shortest distance to any `0`. This "start from the answer" strategy is a powerful technique for shortest path problems.

    Time Complexity:
        O(m * n):
        where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. 
        Every cell is enqueued and processed exactly once, making this the optimal solution.
