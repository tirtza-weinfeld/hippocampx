Title: Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination
Definition: Given an `m x n` grid where cells are either empty (`0`) or an obstacle (`1`), and an integer `k` representing the maximum number of obstacles you can eliminate, find the minimum number of steps to travel from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right `(m-1, n-1)`. Each move (up, down, left, right) costs one step. If no such path exists, return `-1`.
