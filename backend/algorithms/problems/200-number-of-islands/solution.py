    Intuition:
        Find, Count, and Sink üèùÔ∏è
        The strategy is to scan every cell of the grid. If an unvisited piece of land (`1`) is found, you've discovered a new island, so you increment the `islands` counter. Then, immediately launch a BFS from that cell to find and "sink" all connected parts of that same island by changing their value to `0`. This modification of the grid ensures each island group is counted exactly once.

    Time Complexity:
        O(m * n)
        where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. This is optimal as each cell is visited a constant number of times.

    Args:
        grid: 2D grid with '1' representing land and '0' representing water

    Returns:
        Number of islands in the grid
