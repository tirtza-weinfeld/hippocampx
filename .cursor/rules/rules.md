Target audience: AI code generators (like me)

  Purpose: Reference file I read before generating code to know exactly what patterns to produce
  
  Content requirements:
  1. Positive patterns only - Only "do this", never "avoid X"
  2. Concise content - Minimal text, no prose
  3. Concise examples - Shortest code that demonstrates the pattern
  4. Precise - Exact syntax, directly actionable
  5. Modern - 2025+ / canary patterns only
  6. Professional - Production-grade

  Not included:
  - Explanations or reasoning
  - Tutorials or learning material
  - "Avoid" or "don't" sections
  - Comparisons to old patterns
  - Verbose code examples
  - Descriptions of when/why to use

  Result: When I read the file, I immediately know the exact syntax to generate.
