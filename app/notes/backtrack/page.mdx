# Backtracking

## Resizable Table of Contents

## Examples

### 1. N-Queens

*Place n queens on an n x n board such that no two queens threaten each other.*
*[19:]meaning no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.*

[51. N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

```python file=backend/algorithms/backtrack.py#func:solveNQueens
```

> [!insight:collapse] *Backtrack with State Tracking ♛*
>
> * ~ *Place one queen per row. Track blocked columns, diagonals:*
> 	* Valid placement → recurse to next row
> 	* Invalid → skip
> 	* After recursion, remove queen to try next column
>
> * ~ *Track state using:*
> 	* `cols` for columns
> 	* `diag1` for main diagonal *↘*  `row - col`
> 	* `diag2` for anti-diagonal *↙* `row + col`

> [!timecomplexity:collapse] $O(N!)$
>
> •	First row: `$N$` choices
> •	Second: `$\leq N-1$`, and so on
> •	Total permutations = `$N!$`
> •	Pruning drastically reduces actual recursion tree

### 2. Word Search

*Determine if a word exists in a 2D board by following adjacent letters without reuse.*

[79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

> [!insight:collapse] DFS with Early Exit on Mismatch 🔍
>
> Start DFS from each cell. At each step:
	•	Check bounds and character match
	•	Mark visited cell with a temp symbol (e.g. #)
	•	Try 4 directions (no revisiting)
	•	Restore cell after backtracking
Stop early if the full word is matched.

> [!timecomplexity:collapse] $O(MN · 3^L)$
>
> where:
	•	M, N = board size
	•	L = word length
	•	Each step explores at most 3 directions (excluding the one it came from)
	•	Runtime improves with early mismatches and pruning

### 3. Permutations

*Return all permutations of a list of unique numbers.*

[46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

```python file=backend/algorithms/backtrack.py#func:permute
```



> [!insight:collapse] Recursive Tree of Choices 🔁
>
>  *Build permutations by choosing unused elements:*
> •	At each level, try each remaining number
> •	Recurse with updated path
> •	Backtrack to un-choose
> 
> Use used list or boolean flags to track chosen elements.
> 

> [!timecomplexity:collapse] $O(N!)$
>
> •	N levels of recursion
> •	Each level explores N - depth options
> •	Total: N! permutations

### 4. Combination Sum

*Return all unique combinations where chosen numbers sum to a target. Numbers can be reused.*

[39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

```python file=backend/algorithms/backtrack.py#func:combinationSum
```


> [!insight:collapse] DFS with backtracking: 
>
> sort `candidates`, try each starting from current index (to allow reuse), prune if number exceeds remaining target, and record the path when `rem == 0`.

> [!timecomplexity:collapse] $O(2^n)$
>
> Worst-case exponential — `$O(2^n)$` in number of combinations explored — but pruning (`if c > rem: break`) reduces branches significantly.
