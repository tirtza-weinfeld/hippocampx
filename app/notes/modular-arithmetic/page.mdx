## Introduction to Modular Arithmetic

When we divide two integers we will have an equation that looks like the following:



$$
\dfrac{\color{#e11d48}{A}}{\color{#2563eb}{B}} = \color{#059669}{Q} \ \text{\color{#f59e42}{remainder}} \ \color{#f59e42}{R}
$$

$\color{#e11d48}{A}$ is the dividend  
$\color{#2563eb}{B}$ is the divisor  
$\color{#059669}{Q}$ is the quotient  
$\color{#f59e42}{R}$ is the remainder

Sometimes, we are only interested in what the **remainder** is when we divide $A$ by $B$.
For these cases there is an operator called the *modulo operator* (abbreviated as *mod*).
Using the same $\color{#e11d48}{A}$, $\color{#2563eb}{B}$, $\color{#059669}{Q}$, and $\color{#f59e42}{R}$ as above, we would have: 

$$ 
\color{#e11d48}{A}\color{gray}{\pmod{\color{#2563eb}{B}}} = \color{#f59e42}{R} 
$$


## What is Modular Arithmetic?


Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers,
 where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value—the 
 **modulus**.
* **Example:** The most common example is a clock 🕰️. 
 If it's `10` o'clock and `4` hours pass, 
 the time becomes `2` o'clock, not `14`. 
 This is because a clock *wraps around* at a modulus of `12`.

 We use the **modulo operator** (written as `mod` or `%`) 
 to find the remainder of a division.
* **Example:** `14 mod 12 = 2` *or* `14 % 12 = 2`

## Congruence Modulo 

`A ≡ B (mod C)`

Two integers `A` and `B` are **congruent modulo C** if they satisfy two equivalent conditions:

1. They have the **same remainder** when divided by `C`  
*`a % c == b % c`*
    * **Example:** `14 mod 12 = 2` and `2 mod 12 = 2`.

2. Their **difference `(A - B)` is a multiple** of `C`  
*`(a - b) % c == 0`*
    * **Example:** `14 - 2 = 12`, which is a multiple of 12. In programming style, this means `(14 - 2) mod 12 = 0`.

>     If `A` and `B` have the same remainder `r`, we can write `A = q₁C + r`  and `B = q₂C + r`. Subtracting them cancels the remainder `r`, leaving `A - B = (q₁ - q₂)C`, which is a multiple of `C`
> 
> - ~ **Difference is a Multiple → Same Remainder:**
>   If `A - B` is a multiple of `C`, then `A - B = qC`. This means `A = B + qC`. Applying the modulo C operation to both sides, we get `A % C = (B + qC) % C`, the `qC` term's remainder is 0, leaving `A % C = B % C`


## Basic Operations

You can simplify numbers by taking the `mod` before or after an operation.

### Addition
`(A + B) mod C` = `((A mod C) + (B mod C)) mod C`

**Example:** `(14 + 17) mod 5` = `(4 + 2) mod 5` = `1`

### Subtraction

`(A - B) mod C` = `((A mod C) - (B mod C)) mod C`

**Example:** `(14 - 3) mod 5` = `(4 - 3) mod 5` = `1`

### Multiplication

`(A * B) mod C` = `((A mod C) * (B mod C)) mod C`
    
**Example:** `(14 * 17) mod 5` = `(4 * 2) mod 5` = `3`

## Algebraic Properties of Congruence

A powerful feature of congruences is that they behave much like standard algebraic equations. You can add, subtract, or multiply them. This is crucial for solving equations involving modular arithmetic.

### Addition and Subtraction

If you have two separate congruences with the same modulus, you can add or subtract them.

If `A ≡ B (mod C)` and `D ≡ E (mod C)`, then:

$$A + D \equiv B + E \pmod{C}$$
$$A - D \equiv B - E \pmod{C}$$

* **Example:** We know `14 ≡ 2 (mod 12)` and `20 ≡ 8 (mod 12)`.
    * Adding them: `14 + 20 ≡ 2 + 8 (mod 12)` results in `34 ≡ 10 (mod 12)`. This is true, as both sides have a remainder of 10.

### A Special Case: Adding a Constant

The rule that you can add the same integer `k` to both sides of a congruence is a special case of the rule above, where the second congruence is the simple fact that `k ≡ k (mod C)`.

* If we have `A ≡ B (mod C)` and add it to `k ≡ k (mod C)`, we get:
    `A + k ≡ B + k (mod C)`
