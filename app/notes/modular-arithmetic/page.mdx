## What is Modular Arithmetic?

Modular arithmetic is a system where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a value called the **modulus**.
* **Example:** A clock üï∞Ô∏è wraps around at 12. If it's 10 o'clock and you add 4 hours, it becomes 2 o'clock, not 14.

We use the **modulo operator**, `mod`, to find the remainder of a division.
* **Example:** `14 mod 12 = 2`

## Congruence Modulo

Two integers `A` and `B` are **congruent modulo C** (`A ‚â° B mod C`) if they satisfy two equivalent conditions:

1.  They have the **same remainder** when divided by `C`.
    * **Example:** `14 mod 12 = 2` and `2 mod 12 = 2`.

2.  Their **difference `(A - B)` is a multiple** of `C`.
    * **Example:** `14 - 2 = 12`, which is a multiple of 12. In programming style, this means `(14 - 2) mod 12 = 0`.

## Basic Operations

You can simplify numbers by taking the `mod` before or after an operation.

* **Addition:** `(A + B) mod C = ((A mod C) + (B mod C)) mod C`
    * **Example:** `(14 + 17) mod 5 = (4 + 2) mod 5 = 1`

* **Subtraction:** `(A - B) mod C = ((A mod C) - (B mod C)) mod C`
    * **Example:** `(14 - 3) mod 5 = (4 - 3) mod 5 = 1`

* **Multiplication:** `(A * B) mod C = ((A mod C) * (B mod C)) mod C`
    * **Example:** `(14 * 17) mod 5 = (4 * 2) mod 5 = 3`

## Modular Division and Inverses

To "divide" by a number `A`, you instead **multiply by its modular inverse**, `A‚Åª¬π`.

The modular inverse of `A` is a number `A‚Åª¬π` such that `(A * A‚Åª¬π) ‚â° 1 mod C`.
* **Example:** The inverse of `3 mod 10` is `7`, because `(3 * 7) mod 10 = 21 mod 10 = 1`.

An inverse exists only if `A` and `C` are **coprime** (their greatest common divisor is 1).
* **Possible:** ‚úÖ You can "divide by 3" mod 10, since `gcd(3, 10) = 1`.
* **Impossible:** ‚ùå You cannot "divide by 2" mod 10, since `gcd(2, 10) = 2`.

## Fast Modular Exponentiation

This is an efficient algorithm to compute `A^B mod C` without using huge numbers.

The key idea is to use the **binary representation** of the exponent `B`.
* **Example:** To compute `3^10 mod 7`, we use the binary for 10, which is `1010‚ÇÇ`.

This breaks the exponent into a **sum of powers of 2**.
* **Example:** `10 = 8 + 2`, so `3^10` becomes `3^8 * 3^2`.

The algorithm finds these powers by **repeatedly squaring**, applying `mod` at each step.
* **Example:** To find `3^4 mod 7`, you first find `3^2 mod 7 = 2`, then calculate `(2 * 2) mod 7 = 4`.
