## Resizable Table of Contents


## Variant 1: Classical Bellman-Ford 



> [!definition] 
> Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, edge weights $w: E \to \mathbb{R}$, and source node $s$, compute $\delta(s, v)$ for all $v \in V$, or detect a negative-weight cycle reachable from $s$.




> *Algorithm:*
> 1. initialize distance estimates, 
> 2. **Relax all edges |V|–1 times** to compute shortest paths(*where each relaxation improves distance estimates*).
> 3. **Then** do one more pass (the $V$th): 
>       1. if any edge is relaxable (i.e., violates the triangle inequality) → *negative-weight cycle exists*.
>       2. otherwise, *d(s, v) = δ(s, v) for all v ∈ V*

Time: $O(|V||E|)$

Space: $O(|V|)$

> [!comment] 
> This Classical Bellman-Ford solves *SSSP*'s (*single-source shortest paths*),
> only detects whether a negative-weight cycle exists ,it will not return such a negative weight cycle. 

## Variant 2: Graph Duplication with DAG Relaxation

> [!definition] 
>  Let $\delta_k(s, v)$ be the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ using $\leq k$ edges. 
> Construct DAG $G'$ with levels $k = 0$ to $|V|$, each node $v_k$ tracks distance using $k$ edges.
> If $\delta_{|V|}(s, v) < \delta_{|V|-1}(s, v)$, then $v$ is a witness to a negative cycle.

> *Algorithm:*
> 1.	Build $G'$ with (|V|+1) levels
> 2.	Edges:
>       1.	From $v_{k-1} \to v_k$: weight 0
>       2.	From $u_{k-1} \to v_k$: weight $w(u, v)$
> 3.	Run DAG Relaxation from $s_0$
> 4.	Final value $\delta(s, v) = \delta_{|V|-1}(s, v)$ unless reachable from a witness → $-\infty$

> Below we break the function into its five conceptual steps—showing the exact code and explaining how it implements each part of Variant 2:
> 
> 
> 1. **Initialize δ₀ (distance 0 at `source`, ∞ elsewhere)**
> 
>    ```python
>    d = {v: float("inf") for v in vertices}
>    d[source], V = 0, len(vertices)
>    ```
> 
>    * Builds the initial *layer 0* distances, `$δ_0(s, v)$`.
>    * `V` is the number of vertices (so we’ll do V relaxation passes next).
> 
> 2. **Layered relaxation: compute δ₁…δ_V**
> 
>    ```python
>    for k in range(V):            # k = 0…V-1
>        d_k = {**d}               # snapshot of δ_k
>        for u, v, w in edges:
>            if d[u] + w < d_k[v]:
>                d_k[v] = d[u] + w  # build δ_{k+1}(s,v)
>        d = d_k                   # now holds δ_{k+1}
>    ```
> 
>    * Each iteration reads only from the old `d` ($δ_k$) and writes into $d_k$, so no two relaxations chain in one pass.
>    * After pass k you get $δ_{k+1}$ in `d`.
> 
> 3. **Detect direct witnesses ($δ_V < δ_{V-1}$)**
> 
>    ```python
>    witnesses = {
>        v
>        for u, v, w in edges
>        if d[u] + w < d[v]
>    }
>    if not witnesses:
>        return d
>    ```
> 
>    * Any `v` still relaxable on the V-th pass is a **negative-cycle witness**.
> 
> 4. **Build successor list for propagation**
> 
>    ```python
>    adj = defaultdict(list)
>    for u, v, _ in edges:
>        adj[u].append(v)
>    ```
> 
>    * `adj[u]` now lists every direct neighbor of `u` in the original graph, ready for a DFS flood-fill.
> 
> 5. **Flood-fill −∞ from each witness**
> 
>    ```python
>    stack    = list(witnesses)
>    reachable = set(witnesses)
> 
>    while stack:
>        u = stack.pop()
>        d[u] = float("-inf")
>        for v in adj[u]:
>            if v not in reachable:
>                reachable.add(v)
>                stack.append(v)
>    return d
>    ```
> 
>    * Marks each witness **and** every node reachable from it as $-\infty$.
>    * This matches the variant 2's rule: any vertex reachable from a negative-cycle witness inherits $-\infty$.
> 
> ---
> 
> Together, these blocks exactly implement the **layered-DAG duplication** approach:
> 
> * **Steps 1–2** build all k-edge distances δ₀…δ\_V in V passes.
> * **Step 3** finds the true witnesses.
> * **Steps 4–5** propagate the “−∞” label to all cycle-affected vertices.

## Problems

### 1. Cheapest Flight Within K Stops
[Cheapest Flights With at Most K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/description/)

*Find the cheapest flight from `src` to `dst` using at most `k` stops.*

```python file=examples/code/bellman-ford.py#func:findCheapestPrice stripDocstring 
```

> [!deepdive:collapse] 
>
> You have this DP for “at most k stops” (≤k+1 edges):
> 
> ```python
> d = [inf] * n
> d[src] = 0
> 
> for _ in range(k + 1):
>     tmp = d[:]    # snapshot of “≤ i-edge” distances
>     for u, v, w in flights:
>         if d[u] + w < tmp[v]:
>             tmp[v] = d[u] + w
>     d = tmp
> 
> return d[dst] if d[dst] < inf else -1
> ```
> 
> 1. **Interpretation as layered DAG**
> 
>    * Think of a DAG with layers 0…k+1. Layer i holds the best cost to each city using ≤ i flights (edges).
>    * Before any loop, `d = δ₀` (only the source is 0; others ∞).
>    * After loop iteration i (0-indexed), `d = δ_{i+1}`: the best cost using ≤ (i+1) edges.
> 
> 2. **Why the `tmp` array?**
> 
>    * By writing into a fresh copy `tmp` while reading only from the old `d`, you enforce that every relaxation uses exactly one additional edge.
>    * If you instead updated `d` in place, a newly decreased `d[x]` could feed into another relaxation in the same pass—letting you string together multiple edges, which breaks the “≤ i edges” guarantee and degenerates to the classic Bellman-Ford.
> 
> 3. **Mapping to the variant 2's layered-DAG Bellman-Ford**
> 
>    * **variant 2** builds an explicit |V|+1 layer DAG, where each pass relaxes only edges from layer k−1 → k, so after k passes you have δₖ(s,v).
>    * **Our Solution** does the same in “software”: each `for _ in range(k+1)` pass reads δₖ from `d` and writes δₖ₊₁ into `tmp`.
>    * After k+1 passes, `d[v] = δ_{k+1}(s,v)`.
> 
> 4. **Classic (in-place) Bellman-Ford vs. layered version**
> 
>    
>    1. *Classic BF*
>        relaxes all edges in place for V−1 passes → d[v] may already incorporate paths of length > k within pass k.
        runs in O(V·E) time, O(V) space, and can detect negative cycles by one extra pass—but can’t recover them.
>    2. *Layered BF*
>        isolates each pass via a tmp copy → d[v] = δₖ exactly after pass k.
>       * Layered runs in O(V·E) time, O(V·E) space if you build the DAG explicitly (but our code stays O(V+E) space), and can pinpoint witnesses and propagate −∞.
>
>    3. *Our Solution*
>        tmp array simulates the variant 2's DAG without building V×V state.
> 
> 
> 5. **Time complexity**
>    Each of the k+1 passes scans all E edges → $O((k+1)E)$
> 
> ---
> 
> **In summary:** our cheapest-flights solution *is* the layered-DAG Bellman-Ford in disguise. The `tmp` copy enforces strict layering (δₖ→δₖ₊₁), matching
  variant 2's model, while in-place updates would collapse multiple hops per pass into the classic algorithm.
