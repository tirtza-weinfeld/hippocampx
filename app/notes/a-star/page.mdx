## A\* Search Algorithm

A\* is essentially **“BFS + brain”**: instead of exploring purely by distance-so-far (like BFS) or purely by guessed distance-to-go (like a greedy search), it ranks each potential node by:

**`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`**

  * **`g(n)`**: The **actual cost** of steps taken so far from the start.
  * **`h(n)`**: The **heuristic**, an estimated cost of the steps remaining to the target (e.g., Manhattan distance).

By always expanding the node with the lowest `f(n)` score, A\* “hones in” on paths that look cheapest overall. If `h(n)` never overestimates the true remaining distance (i.e., it's *admissible*), A\* is guaranteed to find the shortest path.

### Why It Works: Balancing Cost and Heuristics

The combination of both `g(n)` and `h(n)` is what gives A\* its power. The `g(n)` term grounds the search in reality, preventing it from following a path that looks direct but is actually a costly trap.

For example, imagine finding a path over a mountain. A greedy search (using only `h(n)`) would head straight up a winding, slow trail because it points directly at the goal. However, A\*'s `g(n)` term would quickly increase, reflecting the long time spent on this trail. The algorithm would soon realize that a different path—one that goes around the mountain on a faster road—is better overall, even if it initially seems less direct.

In short, **`h(n)` provides the direction, while `g(n)` ensures the path remains efficient.**

### Optimal Python Implementation (LeetCode 1293)

This code uses the A\* algorithm to solve the "Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination" problem. It features an efficient `max_k` array to prune suboptimal paths.

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def shortestPath(self, grid: list[list[int]], k: int) -> int:
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # Early exit if k is large enough to ignore all obstacles
        min_dist = rows + cols - 2
        if k >= min_dist:
            return min_dist

        # max_k[r][c] stores the best remaining eliminations seen at (r,c)
        max_k = [[-1] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
        max_k[0][0] = k

        # Heuristic function: Manhattan distance
        def heuristic(r, c):
            return (rows - 1 - r) + (cols - 1 - c)

        # Priority queue: (f_score, steps, r, c, remaining_k)
        # f_score = steps (g) + heuristic (h)
        pq = [(heuristic(0,0), 0, 0, 0, k)]
        directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]

        while pq:
            f, steps, r, c, rem_k = heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            if (r, c) == (rows - 1, cols - 1):
                return steps

            # If we've already found a path to this cell with more
            # elimination power, this current path is suboptimal.
            if rem_k < max_k[r][c]:
                continue

            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
                    nk = rem_k - grid[nr][nc]
                    
                    # Explore neighbor only if we can afford it and it's a better state
                    if nk >= 0 and nk > max_k[nr][nc]:
                        max_k[nr][nc] = nk
                        g_new = steps + 1
                        f_new = g_new + heuristic(nr, nc)
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (f_new, g_new, nr, nc, nk))

        return -1
