# Time Complexity


## Resizable Table of Contents

## Summary

> * *$\Omicron$, $\Omega$, $\Theta$* describe the upper, lower, and tight bounds for the *runtime*
> * *Best, worst,expected* cases describe the $\Omicron$, $\Omega$, $\Theta$ time for particular *inputs or scenarios*.
> * Big *$\Omicron$* 
>   * Academically it's any upper bound
>   * Industry merges $\Omicron$ and $\Theta$ , and so $\Omicron$ is usually used to mean the tightest description of growth.

## Academic Definitions

| Symbol | Meaning (Academia) | Analogy | Example |
|--------|--------------------|---------|---------|
| $\Omicron(f(n))$ | Upper bound — runtime grows no faster than f(n) | ≤ (less-than-or-equal) | Printing N elements is $\Omicron(N)$, but also $\Omicron(N²)$, $\Omicron(2ⁿ)$ — all are true upper bounds |
| $\Omega(f(n))$ | Lower bound — runtime grows at least as fast as f(n) | ≥ (greater-than-or-equal) | Printing N elements is $\Omega(N)$, but also $\Omega(1)$ |
| $\Theta(f(n))$ | Tight bound — both $\Omicron(f(n))$ and $\Omega(f(n))$ | = (asymptotically equal) | Printing N elements is $\Theta(N)$ |

## Best / Worst / Expected Case (Input-based)

These describe which inputs you analyze:

| Case | Meaning | QuickSort Example |
|--------|--------------------|---------|
| Best | Fastest scenario | $\Omicron(N)$ — all elements equal (trivial partitions) |
| Worst | Slowest scenario | $\Omicron(N²)$ — pivot always worst (e.g., reversed array) |
| Expected | Average scenario | $\Omicron(N\log N)$ — random pivots |

They do NOT correspond to $\Omicron$ / $\Omega$ / $\Theta$.
You can have:
	* Worst case: $\Omicron( N²)$
	* Best case: $\Omega( N)$
	* Average: $\Theta( N \log N)$

Best, worst, and expected cases measure scenarios, while $\Omicron$, $\Omega$, $\Theta$ measure bounds.
