## The Power of a Pre-Calculated Route

Imagine you're on a long highway road trip. The road has mile markers posted sequentially, 
starting from Mile `0`. If you just passed marker `75` and your exit is at marker `180`, 
you instantly know the distance you have left to travel: `180 - 75 = 105` miles.

These **Highway Markers** are a perfect real-world example of a pre-calculated system. 
Each marker represents the total distance from the start of the highway. 
This allows you to find the distance between *any* two points with a single subtraction, 
without having to measure the road yourself. This is the core idea behind **prefix sums**.



* **For an array of numbers representing sequential trip segments:** 
  * `segment = [120, -30, 200, -50, 150]`
  * This represents the change in position each day: 120km east, then 30km west, 200km east, etc.
* **Its *[13:]prefix_sum* array is the set of highway *[13:]markers*:** 
  * `marker = [120, 90, 290, 240, 390]`
  * This is the mile marker you're at after each day's travel.
  * `marker[i]` = `segment[0]` + `segment[1]` + ... + `segment[i]`.
  * $$marker_i = \sum_{k=0}^{i} segment_k$$
* **The total distance of any continuous "segment" of your trip, from day `i` to day `j`, is simply `Markers[j] - Markers[i-1]`:**
  * $$\sum_{k=i}^{j} segment_k = marker_j - marker_{i-1}$$
    * **Note:** For a range starting at index `0`, the formula is just $marker_j$, since $marker_{-1}$ would be 0.
  * This allows us to answer any range query(*sum of any continuous segment from index `i` to `j`*) in constant $O(1)$ time after one $O(n)$ pass to build the `Markers` array.

By combining this technique with a hash map to remember past marker locations, we can solve a huge range of
 otherwise complex problems with surprising efficiency. Let's see it in action.

## 5\. Counting All Spans Divisible by k

**[LeetCode 974: Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/)**

*How many continuous sequences of trip segments have a total length that is perfectly divisible by k?*


```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:subarraysDivByK stripDocstring
```

> [!deepdive:collapse] 
> *  `sum[i...j]` (*prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]*) is divisible by `k` **iff** `prefix_sum[i]` and `prefix_sum[j]` divided by `k` have an *identical remainder* 
> * Redefine the problem: counting *every pair* of prefix sums that have an *identical remainder* 
>   *  The sum of any subarray is the difference between two prefix sums `sum[i...j] = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]`. [A key principle of modular arithmetic](./modular-arithmetic#congruence-modulo) is that this difference is perfectly divisible by `k` if and only if `prefix_sum[i]` and `prefix_sum[j]`
>  have the exact same remainder when divided by `k`.
>   * Therefore, the problem of finding subarray sums divisible by `k` becomes the simpler problem 
>   of counting *every pair* of prefix sums that have an *identical remainder* .
> 
> *  `prefix_remainder = (prefix_remainder + segment) % k`
>    * This code is a direct application of the [property of modular addition](./modular-arithmetic#addition). `(A + B) mod C = ((A mod C) + (B mod C)) mod C`
>    * This property guarantees that finding the remainder of a sum `(previous_sum + segment) % k` is equivalent to using the remainder from the previous step: `( (previous_sum % k) + segment) % k`.
>    * Since the `prefix_remainder` variable already holds `previous_sum % k`, the code correctly uses this efficient shortcut. It yields the same result without needing to calculate the full, and potentially large, prefix sum.

## 6\. Minimal Segment to Skip

**[LeetCode 1590: Make Sum Divisible by P](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-sum-divisible-by-p/)**

*Your total trip length (the final highway marker) isn’t divisible by `p`. Find the **shortest continuous trip segment** you can remove from your log, so that the length of the remaining segments *is* divisible by `p`.*

```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:minSubarray stripDocstring
```

> [\!deepdive:collapse]
>
> The logic is based on a core principle of [modular congruence `A ≡ B (mod C)`](./modular-arithmetic#congruence-modulo):
>
> 1.  `a % c == b % c` (Two numbers have the same remainder)
> 2.  `(a - b) % c == 0` (Their difference is a multiple of `c`)
>
>
>
> Let's apply this:
>
>   * If `Total Sum % p == Subarray Sum % p`
>   * Then `(Total Sum - Subarray Sum) % p == 0`
>
> Since `Total Sum - Subarray Sum` is the **Remaining Sum**, this proves that removing a subarray with the same remainder makes the new total divisible by `p`.
> 
>  **The Logic and Implementation**
> 
> The reasoning above simplifies our goal: **find the shortest subarray whose sum has the same remainder** as the total sum.
> 
> The code achieves this using prefix sums, where `Subarray Sum = Current Prefix Sum - Past Prefix Sum`. The goal is to find a subarray where `Subarray Sum % p == Total's Remainder`. This leads to the derivation of the `need` variable.
> 
> **Deriving `need`**
> 
> Let's simplify the names for clarity:
> 
>   * `C = Current Prefix Sum`
>   * `P = Past Prefix Sum`
>   * `R = Total's Remainder`
> 
> 
> 1.  **Start with the objective:** We need the subarray's sum (`C - P`) to have the remainder `R`.
>     `(C - P) % p == R`
> 
> 2.  **Isolate the unknown:** We need to find the `Past Prefix Sum` (`P`). Using the rules of modular arithmetic, we can rearrange the equation to solve for `P`.
>     `P % p == (C - R) % p`
> > [!note:collapse] That rearrangement is based on the algebraic rules of **modular congruence**
> > 
> > **The Rule**
> > 
> > The principle is that a modular congruence `A ≡ B (mod p)` behaves like a standard algebraic equation. You can add or subtract the same value on both sides of the `≡` symbol and the congruence remains true.
> > 
> > **Applying the Rule**
> > 
> > 1.  **Start with the equation in congruence form:**
> >     `(C - P) % p == R` is the same as `C - P ≡ R (mod p)`.
> > 
> > 2.  **Rearrange using algebra:** To solve for `P`, you can add `P` to both sides and subtract `R` from both sides.
> >     `C - R ≡ P (mod p)`
> > 
> > 3.  **Convert back:** :
> >     `P % p == (C - R) % p`
> >     
> > Think of `(mod p)` like a unit of measurement, such as "in kilograms" or a currency like "in USD." It's not a number or variable that you move around algebraically.
> > 
> > If you have an equation where all terms are in kilograms:
> > `Weight A = Weight B` (in kg)
> > 
> > And you subtract 5 kg from both sides, the new equation is still valid within that context:
> > `Weight A - 5 kg = Weight B - 5 kg` (in kg)
> > 
> > You don't "move" the "(in kg)" part; it remains as the context for the relationship.
> > 
> > Similarly, `(mod p)` tells us the mathematical system we are working in. All the algebra we perform on `C`, `P`, and `R` happens **within that system**. The `(mod p)` at the end simply states that the congruence relationship is true under those specific rules.
> 
> 3.  **Define `need`:** The term we solved for, `Past Prefix Sum % p`, is the value the code is looking for. This is what **`need`** represents.
>     `need = (C - R) % p`
> 
> **Why add `+ p`?**
> 
> This is a common trick in programming to correctly handle potential negative numbers. The subtraction `(C - R)` could result in a negative value. 
> Adding `p` before the modulo operation ensures the input is always positive, which guarantees a consistent remainder from `0` to `p-1` for the hash map lookup.
> 
> Therefore, `(C - R + p) % p` is the robust, code-friendly way to calculate `(C - R) % p`.
