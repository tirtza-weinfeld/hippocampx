## The Power of a Pre-Calculated Route

Imagine you're on a long highway road trip. The road has mile markers posted sequentially, 
starting from Mile `0`. If you just passed marker `75` and your exit is at marker `180`, 
you instantly know the distance you have left to travel: `180 - 75 = 105` miles.

These **Highway Markers** are a perfect real-world example of a pre-calculated system. 
Each marker represents the total distance from the start of the highway. 
This allows you to find the distance between *any* two points with a single subtraction, 
without having to measure the road yourself. This is the core idea behind **prefix sums**.



* **For an array of numbers representing sequential trip segments:** 
  * `segment = [120, -30, 200, -50, 150]`
  * This represents the change in position each day: 120km east, then 30km west, 200km east, etc.
* **Its `[13:]prefix_sum` array is the set of highway `[13:]markers`:** 
  * `marker = [120, 90, 290, 240, 390]`
  * This is the mile marker you're at after each day's travel.
  * `marker[i]` = `segment[0]` + `segment[1]` + ... + `segment[i]`.
  * $$marker_i = \sum_{k=0}^{i} segment_k$$
* **The total distance of any continuous "segment" of your trip, from day `i` to day `j`, is simply `Markers[j] - Markers[i-1]`:**
  * $$\sum_{k=i}^{j} segment_k = marker_j - marker_{i-1}$$
    * **Note:** For a range starting at index `0`, the formula is just $marker_j$, since $marker_{-1}$ would be 0.
  * This allows us to answer any range query(*sum of any continuous segment from index `i` to `j`*) in constant $O(1)$ time after one $O(n)$ pass to build the `Markers` array.

By combining this technique with a hash map to remember past marker locations, we can solve a huge range of
 otherwise complex problems with surprising efficiency. Let's see it in action.
