## The Power of a Pre-Calculated Route

Imagine you're on a long highway road trip. The road has mile markers posted sequentially, 
starting from Mile `0`. If you just passed marker `75` and your exit is at marker `180`, 
you instantly know the distance you have left to travel: `180 - 75 = 105` miles.

These **Highway Markers** are a perfect real-world example of a pre-calculated system. 
Each marker represents the total distance from the start of the highway. 
This allows you to find the distance between *any* two points with a single subtraction, 
without having to measure the road yourself. This is the core idea behind **prefix sums**.



* **For an array of numbers representing sequential trip segments:** 
  * `segment = [120, -30, 200, -50, 150]`
  * This represents the change in position each day: 120km east, then 30km west, 200km east, etc.
* **Its *[13:]prefix_sum* array is the set of highway *[13:]markers*:** 
  * `marker = [120, 90, 290, 240, 390]`
  * This is the mile marker you're at after each day's travel.
  * `marker[i]` = `segment[0]` + `segment[1]` + ... + `segment[i]`.
  * $$marker_i = \sum_{k=0}^{i} segment_k$$
* **The total distance of any continuous "segment" of your trip, from day `i` to day `j`, is simply `Markers[j] - Markers[i-1]`:**
  * $$\sum_{k=i}^{j} segment_k = marker_j - marker_{i-1}$$
    * **Note:** For a range starting at index `0`, the formula is just $marker_j$, since $marker_{-1}$ would be 0.
  * This allows us to answer any range query(*sum of any continuous segment from index `i` to `j`*) in constant $O(1)$ time after one $O(n)$ pass to build the `Markers` array.

By combining this technique with a hash map to remember past marker locations, we can solve a huge range of
 otherwise complex problems with surprising efficiency. Let's see it in action.

**[LeetCode 525: Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)**

*To balance your driving, find the longest stretch of days with an equal number of forward (+) and backward (-) segments.
This is equivalent to finding the longest subarray that sums to zero after converting forward/backward segments to +/- 1*.

## 5\. Counting All Spans Divisible by k

**[LeetCode 974: Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/)**

*How many continuous sequences of trip segments have a total length that is perfectly divisible by k?*


```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:subarraysDivByK stripDocstring
```

> [!deepdive:collapse] 
> *  `sum[i...j]` (*prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]*) is divisible by `k` **iff** `prefix_sum[i]` and `prefix_sum[j]` divided by `k` have an *identical remainder* 
> * Redefine the problem: counting *every pair* of prefix sums that have an *identical remainder* 
>   *  The sum of any subarray is the difference between two prefix sums `sum[i...j] = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]`. [A key principle of modular arithmetic](./modular-arithmetic#congruence-modulo) is that this difference is perfectly divisible by `k` if and only if `prefix_sum[i]` and `prefix_sum[j]`
>  have the exact same remainder when divided by `k`.
>   * Therefore, the problem of finding subarray sums divisible by `k` becomes the simpler problem 
>   of counting *every pair* of prefix sums that have an *identical remainder* .
> 
> *  `prefix_remainder = (prefix_remainder + segment) % k`
>    * This code is a direct application of the [property of modular addition](./modular-arithmetic#addition). `(A + B) mod C = ((A mod C) + (B mod C)) mod C`
>    * This property guarantees that finding the remainder of a sum `(previous_sum + segment) % k` is equivalent to using the remainder from the previous step: `( (previous_sum % k) + segment) % k`.
>    * Since the `prefix_remainder` variable already holds `previous_sum % k`, the code correctly uses this efficient shortcut. It yields the same result without needing to calculate the full, and potentially large, prefix sum.

## 6\. Minimal Segment to Skip

**[LeetCode 1590: Make Sum Divisible by P](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-sum-divisible-by-p/)**

*Your total trip length (the final highway marker) isn’t divisible by `p`. Find the **shortest continuous trip segment** you can remove from your log, so that the length of the remaining segments *is* divisible by `p`.*

```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:minSubarray stripDocstring
```
> [!deepdive:collapse] 
>
> [a ≡ b (mod c) iff](./modular-arithmetic#congruence-modulo)
> 
> 1. `a % c == b % c` (They have the same remainder when divided by c)
> 
> 2. `(a - b) % c == 0` (Their difference (a - b) is a multiple of c)
> 
> 
> 
> `a = sum(segments)`, `c = p`
> 
> so if we find a subarray with with sum `b` such that `a % c == b % c` 
>  then we know`(a - b) % c = 0` 
> which means removing that sum `b` will make the rest divisable by `c`
>
>
> so the goal is to find the **shortest subarray `b` whose sum has the same remainder** as the total sum.
> 
> Since any subarray's sum is the difference between two prefix sums (`Current Prefix Sum - Past Prefix Sum`), we are looking for:
> 
> `(Current Prefix Sum - Past Prefix Sum) % p == Total's Remainder`
> 
> By rearranging this, we can calculate the exact `Past Prefix Sum` remainder required at any given step. This is the **`need`** variable in the code:
> 
> `need = (Current Prefix Sum % p - Total's Remainder + p) % p`
> 
> A hash map stores the most recent index of each prefix sum remainder encountered. 
> At each step, the code calculates the `need` and checks the map for its index to find the shortest valid subarray.
