## The Power of a Pre-Calculated Route

Imagine you're on a long highway road trip. The road has mile markers posted sequentially, 
starting from Mile `0`. If you just passed marker `75` and your exit is at marker `180`, 
you instantly know the distance you have left to travel: `180 - 75 = 105` miles.

These **Highway Markers** are a perfect real-world example of a pre-calculated system. 
Each marker represents the total distance from the start of the highway. 
This allows you to find the distance between *any* two points with a single subtraction, 
without having to measure the road yourself. This is the core idea behind **prefix sums**.






* **For an array of numbers representing sequential trip segments:** 
  * `segment = [120, -30, 200, -50, 150]`
  * This represents the change in position each day: 120km east, then 30km west, 200km east, etc.
* **Its prefix sum array is the set of highway markers:** 
  * `marker = [120, 90, 290, 240, 390]`
  * This is the mile marker you're at after each day's travel.
  * `marker[i]` is the *sum* of all trip segments from `segment[0]` through the current segment `segment[i]`.
  * $$marker_i = \sum_{k=0}^{i} segment_k$$
* **The total distance of any continuous "segment" of your trip, from day `i` to day `j`, is simply `Markers[j] - Markers[i-1]`:**
  * $$\sum_{k=i}^{j} segment_k = marker_j - marker_{i-1}$$
    * **Note:** For a range starting at index `0`, the formula is just $marker_j$, since $marker_{-1}$ would be 0.
  * This allows us to answer any range query(*sum of any continuous segment from index `i` to `j`*) in constant $O(1)$ time after one $O(n)$ pass to build the `Markers` array.

By combining this technique with a hash map to remember past marker locations, we can solve a huge range of
 otherwise complex problems with surprising efficiency. Let's see it in action.

## 1\. Longest Streak Covering Exassctly k Kilometers

**[LeetCode 325: Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-size-subarray-sum-equals-k/)**

*You need a sightseeing record: find the longest continuous sequence of trip segments whose combined length is exactly **k km**.*

```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:maxSubArrayLen stripDocstring
```

## 2\. Count of Streaks Covering k Kilometers

**[LeetCode 560: Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)**

*How many distinct, continuous sequences of trip segments have a total length of exactly **k km**?*

```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:subarraySum stripDocstring
```

## 3\. Longest Balanced Forward/Backward Day-Count 

**[LeetCode 525: Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)**

*To balance your driving, find the longest stretch of days with an equal number of forward (+) and backward (-) segments.
This is equivalent to finding the longest subarray that sums to zero after converting  forward/backward segments to +/- 1*.

## 4\. Detecting a Segment of k-Multiple Distance

**[LeetCode 523: Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)**

*Did any continuous part of your trip, lasting at least two days, cover a total distance that was an exact **multiple of k km**?*

## 5\. Counting All Spans Divisible by k

**[LeetCode 974: Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/)**

*How many continuous sequences of trip segments have a total length that is perfectly divisible by k?*

```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:subarraysDivByK stripDocstring
```

## 6\. Minimal Segment to Skip

**[LeetCode 1590: Make Sum Divisible by P](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-sum-divisible-by-p/)**

*Your total trip length (the final highway marker) isnâ€™t divisible by `p`. Find the **shortest continuous trip segment** you can remove from your log, so that the length of the remaining segments *is* divisible by `p`.*

```python file=examples/code/prefix_sum.py#func:minSubarray stripDocstring
```

## 7\. Batch Itinerary Updates (Difference Array)

**[LeetCode 370: Range Addition](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition/)**

*You are a trip planner. You start with an itinerary for `length` days, with 0 km planned for each day. You are given a list of `updates`, like `[start_day, end_day, change_in_km]`. You must add `change_in_km` to the plan for each day in that range. What is the final daily travel plan? This is the inverse of our previous problems; we use a "difference array" and find its prefix sum to reveal the final state.*

## 8\. Finding a Valid Starting Point on the Highway

**[LeetCode 2145: Count the Hidden Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-hidden-sequences/)**

*You have a log of your daily trsip segments (`differences`) but forgot your starting point on the highway. You only know that your location at all times (your starting point and every marker you passed) had to be within a valid range of the highway, `[lower, upper]`. How many possible integer **starting markers** could you have begun your trip from?*
