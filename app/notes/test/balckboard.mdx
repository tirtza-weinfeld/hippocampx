## *Question/Problem:*

I want to **copy the solution files from `/new/` to the new problem folders** I created, but I're trying to figure out:

**"What should I name the solution files inside each problem folder?"**

### **The Challenge:**
- I have **56 problem folders** (like `34-find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/`)
- I have **solution files** in `/new/` (like `find_first_and_last_position_of_element_in_sorted_array.py`)
- I **don't think I want** the solution file to have the same name as the folder (like `find_first_and_last_position_of_element_in_sorted_array.py` inside `34-find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/`)
  (should i want?)

### **What I're Trying to Figure Out:**
1. **For problems with only 1 solution:** What should I name the file? (`solution.py`? `main.py`? Something else?)
2. **For problems with multiple solutions:** How to distinguish them? (like `bellman_ford.py` vs `dijkstra.py` for problem 787)
3. **Overall naming strategy** that's consistent and not wasteful/redundant
