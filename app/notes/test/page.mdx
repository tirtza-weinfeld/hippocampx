### The LRU System: The Shelf by the Chair

This system is about pure convenience.

  * **The Setup:** A single shelf starts at a reshelving basket ðŸ§º and ends right next to the librarian's chair.
  * **The Action:**
    1.  When a book is needed (`get` or `put`), the librarian places it on the shelf right beside her chairâ€”at the very **end** of the line.
    2.  As she adds books, the line gets pushed down the shelf until the book at the far end falls into the basket. This evicted book is the one that was least recently used.

The spot by her chair is the **end** of our data structure. The basket is the **beginning**.

#### The Code

  * **`move_to_end()`** places a book by the chair.
  * **`popitem(last=False)`** drops the book at the far end into the basket.


```python
from collections import OrderedDict

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.cache: OrderedDict[int, int] = OrderedDict()
        self.capacity = capacity

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if (val := self.cache.get(key)) is None:
            return -1
        self.cache.move_to_end(key) # Move book to the spot by the chair
        return val

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache.move_to_end(key)
        self.cache[key] = value
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False) # Drop the book into the basket
```

### The LFU System: A Smarter Set of Shelves

The librarian notices a flaw in her simple system: a popular book can be pushed out by a burst of new, less important books. To solve this, she upgrades.

  * **The Setup:** Instead of one shelf, she now has a small bookcase with **multiple shelves**, stacked vertically. This is the **LFU (Least Frequently Used)** system, which tracks a book's **popularity**.
  * **The Action:**
    1.  The shelves represent popularity levels. The **bottom shelf (\#1)** is for newcomers (used once), the shelf above it **(\#2)** is for books used twice, and so on.
    2.  When a book on a lower shelf (say, Shelf \#1) is needed again, it gets a **promotion\!** The librarian moves it up to Shelf \#2 and places it in the spot **right next to her chair**â€”at the end of that new line. It is now the most recently used among all books with a popularity score of two.
    3.  For **eviction**, she always takes from the **bottom shelf (\#1)**, since it holds the least popular books. From that shelf, she removes the book at the far endâ€”the one closest to the basket.

This protects popular books by moving them up the bookcase, away from the eviction zone on the bottom shelf.

#### The Code

The `buckets` dictionary is our bookcase; each key is a shelf number.

```python
from collections import defaultdict, OrderedDict

class LFUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity      = capacity
        self.cache         = {}
        self.freq          = {}
        self.buckets       = defaultdict(OrderedDict)
        self.minfreq       = 0

    def _bump(self, key: int):
        f = self.freq[key]
        del self.buckets[f][key]
        if not self.buckets[f]:
            if self.minfreq == f:
                self.minfreq += 1
        
        # Promote the book to the next shelf up, placing it by the chair.
        self.freq[key] += 1
        self.buckets[f + 1][key] = None

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key not in self.cache:
            return -1
        self._bump(key)
        return self.cache[key]

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if self.capacity <= 0: return

        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache[key] = value
            self._bump(key)
            return

        if len(self.cache) >= self.capacity:
            # Evict from the far end of the least popular shelf.
            old_key, _ = self.buckets[self.minfreq].popitem(last=False)
            del self.cache[old_key]
            del self.freq[old_key]

        # A new book starts on the bottom shelf, by the chair.
        self.cache[key] = value
        self.freq[key] = 1
        self.buckets[1][key] = None
        self.minfreq = 1
