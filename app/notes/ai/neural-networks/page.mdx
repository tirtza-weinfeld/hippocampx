# Neural Networks: Interactive Learning

Explore how neural networks learn to recognize handwritten digits through interactive visualizations. Build, train, and test your own network using the MNIST dataset.

## Interactive Playground

Create your own neural network, watch it train in real-time, and test its predictions. Draw digits or use samples from the MNIST dataset to see how well it performs.

## How It Works

### Neural Network Architecture

A neural network is composed of layers of interconnected neurons. The default architecture uses:

- **Input layer:** 784 neurons (28×28 pixels from MNIST images)
- **Hidden layer:** 30 neurons (customizable)
- **Output layer:** 10 neurons (one for each digit 0-9)

### Training Process

The network learns through a process called **backpropagation**:

1. Show the network an image and its correct label
2. Calculate how wrong the network&apos;s prediction was (the error)
3. Adjust the weights and biases to reduce this error
4. Repeat for thousands of images

### Key Parameters

- **Epochs:** How many times to see all 60,000 training images
- **Mini-batch size:** Update weights after processing N images
- **Learning rate:** How aggressively to adjust weights (3.0 works well for MNIST)

## Understanding the Visualization

### Network Graph

The animated network visualization shows:

- **Neurons** as circles (larger for input/output layers)
- **Connections** as lines between neurons
- **Activation strength** shown by color intensity
- **Data flow** animated from input → hidden → output layers

Use the play/pause and speed controls to explore how signals propagate through the network.

### Prediction Confidence

When you make a prediction, you&apos;ll see:

- **Predicted digit** displayed prominently
- **Confidence percentage** (0-100%)
- **Probability distribution** for all 10 digits (0-9)

The bars show how confident the network is for each possible digit. The highest bar corresponds to the prediction.

### Training Progress

As the network trains, watch:

- **Live accuracy updates** each epoch
- **Progress bar** showing completion
- **Accuracy chart** showing improvement over time

Typical progression: 80% → 90% → 95% accuracy over 30 epochs.

## Tips for Best Results

### Drawing Your Own Digits

**Do:**
- Draw large and centered
- Use thick, clear strokes
- Keep it simple (like MNIST style)

L **Avoid:**
- Tiny digits in corners
- Overly stylized handwriting
- Multiple disconnected strokes

### Experimenting with Architecture

Try different configurations:

- More hidden neurons: `784, 100, 10` (more capacity, slower)
- Deeper networks: `784, 50, 30, 10` (more layers)
- ReLU activation: Often faster than sigmoid
- Different learning rates: 2.0-4.0 range

### Understanding Training Behavior

**Important:** Training is cumulative!

- First training session: Random weights  ~90% accuracy
- Second training session: Continues from 90%  ~93%
- To start fresh: Create a new network first

## The Mathematics Behind It

### Forward Pass

For each layer, the network computes:

```
activation = σ(weights × input + bias)
```

Where σ is the activation function (sigmoid or ReLU).

### Backward Pass (Backpropagation)

The network adjusts weights based on the error:

```
new_weight = old_weight - learning_rate × gradient
```

This process repeats thousands of times until the network learns to recognize patterns.

## Real-World Applications

While this demo uses handwritten digits, the same principles apply to:

- **Image recognition** - Identifying objects in photos
- **Natural language processing** - Understanding text
- **Speech recognition** - Converting audio to text
- **Medical diagnosis** - Analyzing medical images
- **Autonomous vehicles** - Recognizing road signs and obstacles
