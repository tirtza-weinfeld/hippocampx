# Binary search

## Resizable Table of Contents

Binary search is an efficient algorithm that operates on data with a **monotonic property** (e.g., a sorted array). It works by repeatedly halving the search space until a target is found or the space is exhausted.

Binary search is a `$O(\log n)$` efficient algorithm for finding an item in a **sorted** list. 
 It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

The core idea is to compare the target value with the middle element of the array.
 If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, 
 and the search continues on the remaining half.

## Finding the Leftmost Insertion Point 

`bisect_left` determines the index at which a target `x` should be inserted into a sorted list `a` to maintain order.
It finds the **first** position `i` where `a[i] >= x`.

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:simple_bisect_left
```

**Key Logic**: When `a[mid]` is greater than or equal to `x`, we set `hi = mid`. This ensures we keep considering the `mid` index as a potential answer and forces the search to converge on the leftmost possible index.

-----

## Finding the Rightmost Insertion Point 

`bisect_right` is similar but finds the insertion point to the **right** of any existing entries of `x`. It finds the first position `i` where `a[i] > x`.

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:simple_bisect_right
```

**Key Logic**: When `a[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, we set `lo = mid + 1`. This effectively pushes the search past all elements equal to `x`, ensuring the final index is just after the rightmost occurrence.

## Examples



### Pattern 1: Search on Index

This pattern uses an element's value to find its position within a sorted data structure. Python's `bisect` module is the professional standard for this.

**Problem: Search Insert Position** ([LeetCode 35](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/))

  * **Problem Definition:** Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, find the index of the target. If absent, return the index where it would be inserted to maintain order.

  * **Code Snippet:**

    ```python
    from bisect import bisect_left

    def searchInsert(nums: list[int], target: int) -> int:
        return bisect_left(nums, target)
    ```

  * **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ This problem is a direct application of **binary search on an index**. The `bisect_left` function is purpose-built for this, returning the exact insertion point in $O(\\log n)$ time, making it the ideal tool.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(\\log n)$

### Pattern 2: Search on Index for Boundaries

This extends the first pattern to find the full range of a target that may appear multiple times.

**Problem: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array** ([LeetCode 34](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/))

  * **Problem Definition:** Given a sorted array of integers `nums` that may contain duplicates, find the starting and ending indices of a given `target`. If the target is not in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

  * **Code Snippet:**

    ```python
    from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

    def searchRange(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        start = bisect_left(nums, target)
        if start == len(nums) or nums[start] != target:
            return [-1, -1]
        
        end = bisect_right(nums, target) - 1
        return [start, end]
    ```

  * **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ This problem is elegantly solved by using two **binary searches on index**. `bisect_left` finds the first position where `target` could be inserted, and `bisect_right` finds the first position *after* all existing `target`s. Combining them is the most robust way to find the boundaries.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(\\log n)$

### Pattern 3: Search with a Modified Condition

This pattern is required when the data isn't strictly sorted but has a custom monotonic property (e.g., a rotated array). A manual implementation is necessary as standard libraries don't cover these unique conditions.

**Problem: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array** ([LeetCode 153](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/))

  * **Problem Definition:** Given a unique-element sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot, find its minimum value.

  * **Code Snippet:**

    ```python
    def findMin(nums: list[int]) -> int:
        low, high = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while low < high:
            mid = low + (high - low) // 2
            if nums[mid] > nums[high]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return nums[low]
    ```

  * **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ This is a **binary search on index with a modified condition**. You must implement the logic manually. The key is comparing `nums[mid]` to an endpoint (`nums[high]`) to determine which half contains the rotational pivot (the minimum) and can't be discarded.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(\\log n)$

### Pattern 4: Search on the Answer Space

This advanced pattern solves optimization problems by searching within a conceptual range of possible answers to find the most optimal one that satisfies specific constraints.

**Problem: Koko Eating Bananas** ([LeetCode 875](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/))

  * **Problem Definition:** Given `n` piles of bananas and `h` hours, find the minimum integer eating speed `k` required to consume all bananas within the time limit.

  * **Code Snippet:**

    ```python
    import math

    def minEatingSpeed(piles: list[int], h: int) -> int:
        low, high = 1, max(piles)
        min_speed = high

        while low <= high:
            k = low + (high - low) // 2
            # Handle potential division by zero if low can be 0
            if k == 0:
                low = 1
                continue
            
            hours_taken = sum(math.ceil(p / k) for p in piles)

            if hours_taken <= h:
                min_speed = k
                high = k - 1
            else:
                low = k + 1
        
        return min_speed
    ```

  * **Tip:** ðŸ’¡ This problem requires a **binary search on the answer space**. The search space is the range of possible speeds (`k`). The algorithm must be manually implemented to test each `k` against the problem's constraints (`hours_taken <= h`) to find the lowest valid speed.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(n \\log m)$, where $n$ is the number of piles and $m$ is the maximum pile size.
