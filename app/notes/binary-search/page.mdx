# Binary search

## Resizable Table of Contents

Binary search is an efficient `$O(\log n)$` algorithm for finding an item in a **sorted** list. 
 It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

The core idea is to compare the target value with the middle element of the array.
 If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, 
 and the search continues on the remaining half.

## Finding the Leftmost Insertion Point 

*Given a sorted list `a` and a target `x`, return the index at which `x` should be inserted to maintain order.
(i.e. **first** position `i` where `a[i] >= x`)*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:simple_bisect_left 
```

>[!tip] 
>When `a[mid]` is greater than or equal to `x`, we set `hi = mid`.
 This ensures we keep considering the `mid` index as a potential answer and forces the search to
  converge on the leftmost possible index.

-----

## Finding the Rightmost Insertion Point 

*Given a sorted list `a` and a target `x`, return the index at which `x` should be inserted to maintain order.
(i.e. **first** position `i` where `a[i] > x`)*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:simple_bisect_right
```

>[!tip] 
>When `a[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, we set `lo = mid + 1`. This effectively pushes the search past all elements equal to `x`, ensuring the final index is just after the rightmost occurrence.

## Examples


### 1. Search Insert Position

[35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

*Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, find the index of the target.
If absent, return the index where it would be inserted to maintain order.*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:searchInsert
```

  >[!tip] 
  Python's `bisect` module is the standard for binary search.
  See [Finding the Leftmost Insertion Point](#finding-the-leftmost-insertion-point) for simplified `bisect_left`.

### 2. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

[34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

*Given a sorted array of integers `nums` that may contain duplicates, 
find the starting and ending indices of a given `target`. If the target is not in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:searchRange
```

  >[!tip] 
   [bisect_left](#simple_bisect_left) finds the first position where `target` could be inserted, and
    [bisect_right](#simple_bisect_right) finds the first position *after* all 
  existing `target`s.

### 4. Koko Eating Bananas

[875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

*Given `n` piles of bananas and `h` hours, find the minimum integer eating speed `k` required to consume all bananas within the time limit.*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:minEatingSpeed
```

 
  >[!timecomplexity] $O(n \log m)$, where `$n$` is the number of piles and `$m$` is the maximum pile size.
