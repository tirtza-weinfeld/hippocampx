# Binary search

## Resizable Table of Contents

Binary search is an efficient `$O(\log n)$` algorithm for finding an item in a **sorted** list . 
 It works by repeatedly dividing the list in half.

The core idea is to compare the target value with the middle element of the list.
 If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, 
 and the search continues on the remaining half.

Let `(D, ≤)` be a totally ordered set, and let `$P\colon D\to\{\mathsf{false} < \mathsf{true}\}$` be a monotonic predicate.

Binary search finds `$\alpha = \min\{x\in D\mid P(x)=\mathsf{true}\}$` in `$O(\log|D|)$` time by maintaining an interval `$[\ell,r)$`, probing the midpoint `$m=\lfloor(\ell+r)/2\rfloor$`, and discarding the half in which `$\alpha$` cannot lie, repeating until `$\ell = r = \alpha$`.

## Finding the Leftmost Insertion Point 

*Given a sorted list `a` and a target `x`, return the index at which `x` should be inserted to maintain order.
(i.e. **first** position `i` where `a[i] >= x`)*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:simple_bisect_left 
```

>[!tip] 
>When `a[mid]` is greater than or equal to `x`, we set `r = mid`.
 This ensures we keep considering the `mid` index as a potential answer and forces the search to
  converge on the leftmost possible index.

-----

## Finding the Rightmost Insertion Point 

*Given a sorted list `a` and a target `x`, return the index at which `x` should be inserted to maintain order.
(i.e. **first** position `i` where `a[i] > x`)*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:simple_bisect_right
```

>[!tip] 
>When `a[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, we set `l = mid + 1`.
 This effectively pushes the search past all elements equal to `x`, ensuring the final index is just after the rightmost occurrence.

## Examples


### 1. Search Insert Position

[35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

*Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, find the index of the target.
If absent, return the index where it would be inserted to maintain order.*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:searchInsert
```

  >[!tip] 
  Python's `bisect` module is the standard for binary search.
  See [Finding the Leftmost Insertion Point](#finding-the-leftmost-insertion-point) for simplified `bisect_left`.

### 2. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

[34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

*Given a sorted array of integers `nums` that may contain duplicates, 
find the starting and ending indices of a given `target`. If the target is not in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:searchRange
```
  >[!tip] 
   [bisect_left](#simple_bisect_left) finds the first position where `target` could be inserted, and
    [bisect_right](#simple_bisect_right) finds the first position *after* all 
  existing `target`s.

### 3. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
[153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

*Given a unique-element sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot, find its minimum value.*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:findMin
```

> [!intuition:collapse] 
> The goal is to find the *inflection point* in the rotated list (where the numbers switch from high to low) — this point is the minimum element. 
> We use a modified binary search to home in on this point.
>
> The key is comparing the middle element `nums[mid]` with the rightmost element `nums[r]`. This comparison tells us which part of the array is currently sorted and can be discarded.
>
> -   **Case 1: `nums[mid] < nums[r]`**
>     -   **Example:** In `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`, if `mid` points to `1`, `nums[mid]` (`1`) is less than `nums[r]` (`3`).
>     -   **Logic:** This indicates that the entire right portion of the array from `mid` to `r` (i.e., `[1, 2, 3]`) is sorted. The minimum element could be `nums[mid]` itself, or it could be to its left. We can safely search the left half (including `mid`) by setting `r = mid`.
>
> -   **Case 2: `nums[mid] >= nums[r]`**
>     -   **Example:** In `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`, if `mid` points to `5` in an earlier step, `nums[mid]` (`5`) is greater than `nums[r]` (`3`).
>     -   **Logic:** This indicates that the inflection point (the minimum value) must lie to the right of `mid`. The left portion `[4, 5]` is sorted but contains values larger than the true minimum. We discard this left portion by setting `l = mid + 1`.
>
> The loop terminates when `l` and `r` converge, at which point `nums[l]` is the smallest element.

### 4. Koko Eating Bananas

[875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)



*Given banana piles `piles` and hour limit `h`, 
find the minimum eating speed `$k∈ℕ$` such that 
`$\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{|piles|} \left\lceil \frac{p_i}{k} \right\rceil \le h$`
where each hour Koko eats up to `$k$` bananas from one pile
(any leftover hour is wasted)*

```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:minEatingSpeed
```
> [\!intuition:collapse] *binary searching the answer space, (the eating speed `k`)*
>
> The range of possible speeds is from `1` to `max(piles)`.
>
> The key property is that the problem is **monotonic** (if a speed `k` is fast enough, any speed greater than `k` will also be fast enough). This allows us to binary search for the *minimum* valid speed.
>
> We test a mid speed (`k = (l + r) // 2`). If it's valid (`hours(k) <= h`), we try to find a smaller valid speed by searching the lower half (`r = k`). If it's too slow, we must increase the speed by searching the upper half (`l = k + 1`). The loop converges on the smallest `k` that works. 🍌

> [\!timecomplexity]
> $O(n \log m)$, where `$n$` is the number of piles and `$m$` is the maximum pile size.

### 5. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

[1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

*Given a list of weights and a number of days, find the minimum capacity of a ship that can ship all the weights within the given number of days.*



```python file=examples/code/binary_search.py#func:shipWithinDays
```




> [!intuition:collapse] Binary Search on the Answer Space *(ship's capacity)*
>
> The search space for the answer (the ship's capacity) ranges from a lower bound of `max(weights)`to carry the heaviest item, to an upper bound of `sum(weights)` to ship everything in one day.
>
> The problem has a **monotonic property** ideal for binary search. The function `daysNeeded(capacity)` is monotonically non-increasing: as `capacity` grows, the days required can only decrease or stay the same.
>
> This creates a predictable `[False, ..., False, True, ..., True]` sequence for our condition, `daysNeeded(capacity) <= days`. The goal is to find the leftmost `True`, which represents the minimal valid capacity.
>
> -   If `daysNeeded(capacity) <= days` is `True`, then `capacity` is a potential answer, and we try for a better (smaller) one in the left half by setting `r = capacity`.
> -   If it is `False`, then `capacity` is too small, and we must search for a larger capacity in the right half by setting `l = capacity + 1`.
