#### 1.1 Valid Sudoku

[36. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

*Given a partially filled 9×9 board with digits $1$–$9$ and $.$ for empty cells, determine if it is valid* 
*[19!]no duplicates in any row, column, or 3×3 sub-box. You do not need to solve it.*

```python file=problems/36-valid-sudoku/solution.py
```

> [!insight:collapse] *cube_index and think locally*
>
> - `cube_index := (r // 3) * 3 + (c // 3)` treats the 9×9 board as a 3×3 grid of 3×3 boxes:
>   - `r//3` gives which box-row (0,1,2) you’re in
>   - `c//3` gives which box-column (0,1,2)
> 	- Multiplying the box-row by 3 and adding the box-column yields a unique index 0–8 for each 3×3 cube
>
> - *Think locally* If a repeated digit is found in a row, column, or cube, instantly stop.


> [!timecomplexity:collapse] $O(81)$ (*[19!]i.e.,* $O(n^2)$)
>
> Fixed 9×9 boards scan at most 81 cells. Generalized $n×n$ Sudoku validation runs in $O(n^2)$ time.








#### 1.2 Sudoku Solver

[37. Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)

*Given a partially filled 9×9 board with digits $1$–$9$ and $.$ for empty cells, solve it.*
*[19!]It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution*

```python file=problems/37-sudoku-solver/solution.py
```

> [!insight:collapse] *MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)*
>
> * Candidates per cell: `{'1'..'9'} − (row $∪$ col $∪$ box)`.
> * **MRV:** pick the empty cell with the fewest candidates to prune hardest.
> * Place a digit *tentatively*, update sets, recurse; undo on failure (**backtrack**).
> * If any cell has **0 candidates**, the branch is impossible → backtrack immediately.



> [!complexity:collapse] *Sudoku Solver (MRV) — Complexity*
>
> Let **k** be the number of empty cells (≤ 81).
> * **Time:**
>   * worst case **$O(9^k)$**
>   * practically $\Theta\!\big(\prod_{t=1}^{k} m_t\big)$ where $m_t$ = MRV-picked cell’s candidate count at step $t$ (usually ≪ 9)
>   * MRV selection adds $O(k)$ per level (≤ $O(k^2)$ per path), dominated by the search
> * **Space:**
>   * board/bookkeeping is constant on fixed 9×9 ⇒ **$O(1)$**
>   * recursion depth **$O(k)$**
