# Stack
## Resizable Table of Contents

## Definition

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)** principle. Think of it like a stack of plates: you can only add a new plate to the top or remove the topmost plate. The main operations are:

  * **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  * **Pop**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
  * **Peek (or Top)**: Returns the top element without removing it.

In Python, you can easily implement a stack using a list, where `append()` is `push` and `pop()` is `pop`.

## Problems

### 1\. Valid Parentheses

*Checks if a string containing `'()', '{}', '[]'` has balanced and correctly ordered brackets.*

[20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in s:
        if char in mapping:
            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
            if mapping[char] != top_element:
                return False
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    return not stack
```

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When you encounter a closing bracket, check if the top of the stack is its corresponding opening bracket. If it is, pop from the stack. If not, or if the stack is empty, the string is invalid.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.
  * **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ in the worst case (e.g., a string of all opening brackets).

### 2\. Min Stack

*Design a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `top`, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.*

[155. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

```python
class MinStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.min_stack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        val = min(val, self.min_stack[-1] if self.min_stack else val)
        self.min_stack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        self.min_stack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.min_stack[-1]
```

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Use an auxiliary stack (`min_stack`) that stores the minimum value seen *so far* at each level of the main stack. When you push a new value, you push `min(new_value, current_min)` onto the `min_stack`. This ensures `getMin()` is always an $O(1)$ operation.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(1)$ for all operations (`push`, `pop`, `top`, `getMin`).
  * **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the stack.

### 3\. Daily Temperatures

*Given a list of daily temperatures, return a list where each element is the number of days you'd have to wait for a warmer temperature. If there's no warmer day, use 0.*

[739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

```python
def dailyTemperatures(temperatures: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    n = len(temperatures)
    result = [0] * n
    # Stack stores indices of temperatures
    stack = []  
    for i, temp in enumerate(temperatures):
        # While stack is not empty and current temp is warmer than temp at stack's top index
        while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] < temp:
            prev_index = stack.pop()
            result[prev_index] = i - prev_index
        stack.append(i)
    return result
```

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** This problem is a classic example of using a **monotonic stack**. The stack maintains a list of indices of days with decreasing temperatures. When you encounter a day that's warmer than the day at the top of the stack, you've found the "next warmer day" for that previous day. Pop from the stack and calculate the day difference until the condition is no longer met.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, because each index is pushed and popped at most once.
  * **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ in the worst case (a strictly decreasing list of temperatures).

### 4\. Decode String

*Decode a string that is encoded with the rule `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is repeated exactly `k` times.*

[394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

```python
def decodeString(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    current_num = 0
    current_string = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():
            current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
        elif char == '[':
            # Push the string and number we had before this new scope
            stack.append(current_string)
            stack.append(current_num)
            # Reset for the new scope
            current_string = ""
            current_num = 0
        elif char == ']':
            # Pop the number and previous string for this scope
            num = stack.pop()
            prev_string = stack.pop()
            current_string = prev_string + num * current_string
        else:
            current_string += char
    return current_string
```

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** Use a single stack to manage nested context. When you encounter an opening bracket `[`, push the `current_string` built so far and the `current_num` onto the stack. When you see a closing bracket `]`, pop the count and the previous string, perform the multiplication, and prepend the result.

  * **Time Complexity:** $O(M)$, where $M$ is the length of the fully decoded string.
  * **Space Complexity:** $O(M)$, as the stack can store parts of the decoded string in the worst case.
