# Testing Code Tooltips

This page tests the code tooltip functionality with Python symbols extracted from our examples.

## LRU Cache Example

Here's how to use the LRU cache:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

# Create an LRU cache with capacity 2
cache = LRUCache(2)

# Add some items
cache.put(1, 1)
cache.put(2, 2)

# Get an item (should return 1)
print(cache.get(1))

# Add a new item (should evict the least recently used)
cache.put(3, 3)

# This should return -1 (not found)
print(cache.get(2))
```

## Prefix Sum Functions

Here are some useful prefix sum functions:

```python
def example_usage():
    nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3]
    
    # Find maximum subarray length with sum k
    max_len = maxSubArrayLen(nums, 3)
    
    # Count subarrays with sum k
    count = subarraySum(nums, 3)
    
    # Check if there's a subarray with sum divisible by k
    has_divisible = checkSubarraySum(nums, 2)
    
    return max_len, count, has_divisible
```

## LFU Cache Example

Here's the LFU cache in action:

```python
# Create an LFU cache
lfu = LFUCache(2)

# Add items
lfu.put(1, 1)
lfu.put(2, 2)

# Get item 1 (increases its frequency)
print(lfu.get(1))

# Add item 3 (should evict item 2 since it has lower frequency)
lfu.put(3, 3)

# This should return -1 (item 2 was evicted)
print(lfu.get(2))
```
