## What Are Skills?

Skills are **procedural knowledge** — folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude discovers and loads dynamically when relevant. Think of them as specialized training materials.

Key insight: **Projects say "here's what you need to know." Skills say "here's how to do things."**

## How Loading Works

Skills use **progressive disclosure**:

1. **Metadata loads first** (~100 tokens) — name, description, globs
2. **Full instructions load when needed** (&lt;5k tokens)
3. **Bundled files load only as required**

This keeps context efficient by avoiding overload.

## File Structure

```
.claude/skills/
└── react-19/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions
    ├── examples/         # Optional: code examples
    │   └── component.tsx
    └── templates/        # Optional: starter files
```

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: react-19
description: Modern React 19.2+ patterns and best practices
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]

# React 19.2+ Patterns

You are an expert in modern React. When writing components:

## Do Use
- `ref` as a prop (no forwardRef)
- `use()` for data fetching
- `useActionState` for forms
- `useEffectEvent` for stable callbacks
- `<Activity>` for hide/show without unmount
- `<ViewTransition>` for animations
- Server Components by default

## Don't Use
- forwardRef (deprecated)
- useCallback/useMemo (compiler handles it)
- useEffect for data fetching
- onChange + useState for forms
```

## Frontmatter Options

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier |
| `description` | Yes | When this skill applies |
| `globs` | No | File patterns that trigger loading |

## Progressive Disclosure

Nested skills load only when needed:

```
.claude/skills/react-19/
├── SKILL.md              # Core patterns (always loaded)
├── forms/
│   └── SKILL.md          # Form-specific (loaded for form work)
└── server-components/
    └── SKILL.md          # RSC-specific (loaded for RSC work)
```

## Including Examples

**Examples in context influence generation more than instructions.**

```
.claude/skills/react-19/
├── SKILL.md
└── examples/
    ├── form-action.tsx
    ├── data-fetch.tsx
    └── server-component.tsx
```

Reference in SKILL.md:
```markdown
See `examples/form-action.tsx` for the correct pattern.
```

## When to Use Skills

Skills excel for:
- **Coding patterns** — React 19, TypeScript, testing approaches
- **Personal workflows** — note-taking, research methods
- **Domain expertise** — data analysis, API design

Convert recurring prompts into Skills for persistent, conversation-spanning expertise.

## Skills vs Other Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Persistence | Best For |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Skills** | Procedural knowledge | Across conversations | Reusable procedures |
| **Subagents** | Task delegation | Per task | Isolated specialized work |
| **MCP** | Tool connectivity | Continuous | External data/APIs |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Project context | Always loaded | Project-specific info |
