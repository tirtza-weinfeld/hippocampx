## Core Concepts

| Concept              | Definition                                   | AI Relevance                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Set**              | A collection of distinct objects (elements). | Represents datasets, feature sets.        |
| **Element (∈)**      | Membership relation (e.g. $2 \in \{1,2,3\}$).      | Membership in class, label, or feature.   |
| **Subset (⊆)**       | All elements of A are in B.                  | Feature subsets, decision boundaries.     |
| **Union (∪)**        | Combine all elements.                        | Merge datasets, combined features.        |
| **Intersection (∩)** | Common elements.                             | Shared attributes or overlapping classes. |
| **Difference (−)**   | Elements in one not in another.              | Exclusive features or negative classes.   |
| **Complement (Aᶜ)**  | Elements not in A (in universal set).        | Negation in logic, missing data.          |

## Special Sets

* **Empty Set (∅)** – No elements → null dataset
* **Universal Set (U)** – All possible elements → domain space
* **Power Set (𝒫(A))** – All subsets of A → used in combinatorial feature selection

---

## Relations & Functions

* **Relation:** Subset of `A × B` → pairs like `(input, output)`
* **Function:** Special relation mapping each input to one output
  → `f: X → Y` is core to ML models

## Operations in AI

| Area                  | Application                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Logic & Inference** | Rule-based AI uses set operations       |
| **Clustering**        | Sets of points grouped by similarity    |
| **Classification**    | Classes as sets; sample membership      |
| **Feature Selection** | Power sets, intersections               |
| **Fuzzy Sets**        | Degrees of membership (for uncertainty) |

## 5. **Fuzzy Sets (AI Extension)**

* **Classical**: `x ∈ A` or not
* **Fuzzy**: `x ∈ A` with degree μ(x) ∈ [0,1]
  Used in **fuzzy logic** and **uncertainty modeling**.
