[CITIZENS OF OZ]
Good news
She's dead
The Witch of the West is dead
The wickedest witch there ever was
The enemy of all of us here in Oz
Is dead!
Good news
Good news

[SOMEONE IN THE CROWD, spoken]
Look! It's Glinda!

[GLINDA, spoken]
Fellow Ozians

[GLINDA]
Let us be glad
Let us be grateful
Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue
The wicked workings of you-know-who
Isn't it nice to know?
That good will conquer evil?
The truth we all believe'll by and by
Outlive a lie
For you and—

[SOMEONE IN THE CROWD]
No one mourns the Wicked

[ANOTHER PERSON]
No one cries, "They won't return!"

[ALL]
No one lays a lily on their grave

[MAN]
The good man scorns the Wicked

[WOMEN]
Through their lives, our children learn

[ALL]
What we miss when we misbehave

[GLINDA]
And Goodness knows the Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows the Wicked die alone
It just shows, when you're wicked
You're left only on your own

[ALL]
Yes, Goodness knows the Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows the Wicked cry alone
Nothing grows for the Wicked
They reap only what they've sown


[GLINDA, spoken]
Are people born Wicked?
Or do they have Wickedness thrust upon them?
After all, she had a father
She had a mother, as so many do

[FREXSPAR]
How I hate to go and leave you lonely

[MELENA]
That's alright, it's only just one night

[FREXSPAR]
But know that you're here in my heart
While I'm out of your sight

[GLINDA, spoken]
And, like every family, they had their secrets

[LOVER]
Have another drink, my dark-eyed beauty
I've got one more night left here in town
So have another drink of green elixir
And we'll have ourselves a little mixer
Have another little swallow, little lady
And follow me down


[GLINDA, spoken]
And of course, from the moment she was born, she was
Well, different

[MIDWIFE, spoken]
It's coming!

[FREXSPAR, spoken]
Now?

[MIDWIFE, spoken]
The baby's coming!

[FREXSPAR, spoken]
And how!

[MIDWIFE]
I see a nose

[FREXSPAR]
I see a curl

[FREXSPAR & MIDWIFE]
It's a healthy, perfect, lovely, little—

[MIDWIFE screams.]

[FREXSPAR, spoken]
Sweet Oz!

[MELENA, spoken]
What is it? What's wrong?

[MIDWIFE]
How can it be?

[FREXSPAR]
What does it mean?

[MIDWIFE]
It's atrocious!

[FREXSPAR]
It's obscene!

[MIDWIFE & FREXSPAR]
Like a froggy, ferny cabbage
The baby is unnaturally

[ALL]
Green

[FREXSPAR, spoken]
Take it away
Take it away!

[GLINDA, spoken]
So you see, it couldn't have been easy

[ALL]
No one mourns the Wicked
Now, at last, she's dead and gone!
Now, at last, there's joy throughout the land
And Goodness knows
We know what Goodness is
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone

[GLINDA]
She died alone

[ALL]
Woe to those (Woe to those)
Who spurn what Goodnesses
They are shown
No one mourns the Wicked

[GLINDA]
Good news!

[CROWD]
No one mourns the Wicked

[GLINDA]
Good news

[ALL]
No one mourns the Wicked
Wicked
Wicked
