[FATES]
Doubt comes in
And strips the paint
Doubt comes in
And turns the wine
Doubt comes in and leaves a trace
Of vinegar and turpentine

[FATES and ORPHEUS]
Where are you?
Where are you now?

[FATES]
Doubt comes in
And kills the lights
Doubt comes in
And chills the air

[ORPHEUS]
Doubt comes in and all falls silent
It’s as though you aren’t there

[FATES and ORPHEUS]
Where are you?
Where are you now?

[EURYDICE]
Orpheus
You’re shivering
Is it cold or fear?
Just keep singing
The coldest night
Of the coldest year
Comes right before the spring

[FATES]
Doubt comes in
With tricky fingers
Doubt comes in
With fickle tongues

[ORPHEUS]
Doubt comes in and my heart falters
And forgets the songs it sung

[FATES and ORPHEUS]
Where are you?
Where are you now?

[EURYDICE]
Orpheus
Hold on, hold on tight
It won’t be long
’cause the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
Comes right before the dawn--


[ORPHEUS turns around and EURYDICE gasps]
