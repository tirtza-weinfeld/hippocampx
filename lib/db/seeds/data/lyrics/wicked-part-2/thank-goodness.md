[GLINDA]
Oh, what a celebration we'll have today

[CITIZENS OF OZ]
Thank goodness

[GLINDA]
Let's have a celebration the Glinda way

[CITIZENS OF OZ]
Thank goodness

[MADAM MORRIBLE]
Finally a day that's totally wicked witch free

[CITIZENS OF OZ]
We couldn't be happier, thank goodness

[MADAM MORRIBLE, spoken]
Thank goodness for you, Glinda
And your handsome swain, Prince Fiyero
Newly appointed captain of the Gale Force
Tell us, Captain, how does it feel being engaged?

[FIYERO, spoken]
We're engaged?

[GLINDA, spoken]
Surprised?

[FIYERO, spoken]
Yes

[GLINDA, spoken]
Good, we hoped you'd be
The wizard and I

[GLINDA]
We couldn't be happier, right, dear?
Couldn't be happier right here
Look what we've got, a fairy-tale plot
Our very own happy ending
Where we couldn't be happier, true, dear?
Couldn't be happier
And we're happy to share our ending vicariously with all of you
He couldn't look handsomer
I couldn't feel humbler
We couldn't be happier
Because happy is what happens when all your dreams come true

[MADAM MORRIBLE, spoken]
And Glinda dear, we are happy for you
As press secretary, I've striven to ensure that all of Oz knows the story of your braverism
In the face of the terrifying Wicked Witch of the West


[PEOPLE IN THE CROWD]
I hear she has an extra eye that always remains awake
I hear that she can shed her skin as easily as a snake
I hear some rebel animals are giving her food and shelter
I hear her soul is so unclean pure water can melt her

[CROWD]
Melt her
Please, somebody go and melt her

[FIYERO, spoken]
I can't just stand there grinning, pretending to go along with all this

[GLINDA, spoken]
Fiyero
Thanks plenty, dearest
He's, um, he's gone to fetch me a refreshment
He's so thoughtful that way

[GLINDA]
That's why I couldn't be happier
No, I couldn't be happier
Though it is, I admit, the tiniest bit
Unlike I anticipated
But I couldn't be happier
Simply couldn't be happier
Well, not simply, 'cause getting your dreams, it's strange, but it seems
A little, well, complicated
There's a kind of a sort of cost
There's a couple of things get lost
There are bridges you cross you didn't know you crossed until you've crossed


And if that joy, that thrill
Doesn't thrill like you think it will
Still, with this perfect finale, the cheers and the ballyhoo
Who wouldn't be happier?
So I couldn't be happier
Because happy is what happens when all your dreams come true
Well, isn't it?
Happy is what happens when your dreams come true

[CROWD]
We love you, Glinda, if we may be so frank

[GLINDA]
Thank goodness

[CROWD]
For all this joy, we know who we've got to thank
Thank goodness
That means the Wizard, Glinda

[GLINDA]
And fiancé

[CROWD]
They couldn't be goodlier
She couldn't be lovelier
We couldn't be luckier

[GLINDA]
I couldn't be happier

[CROWD]
Thank goodness (Thank goodness)

[GLINDA & CROWD]
Today

[CROWD]
Thank goodness for today
Thank goodness for today
