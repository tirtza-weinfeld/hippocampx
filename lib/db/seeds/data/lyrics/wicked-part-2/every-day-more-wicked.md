[OZIANS]
Every day more wicked
Every day, the terror grows
All of Oz is ever on alert
That's the way with wicked
Spreading fear where'er she goes
Seeking out new victims she can hurt

[MADAME MORRIBLE]
Like some terrible green blizzard
Throughout the land she flies
Defaming our poor Wizard
With her calumnies and lies

[ALL]
She lies
She lies

[OZIANS]
Save us from the wicked
Shield us so we won't be hexеd
Give us warning, where will shе strike next?
Where will she strike next?
Where will she strike next?

[ELPHABA]
When I stop the Wizard
All Oz will applaud
How I saved them from the Wizard
By revealing he's a fraud
If I can just make them believe in the truth
That all that he says is a lie
That's when they'll finally bid
The Wizard goodbye

[OZIANS]
Dearest Glinda, you are still the best
Others are good, but you're the goodliest
We feel merry, we feel cheery
Just to gaze on your reflection
Only you disprove the theory
That you can't improve perfection

[GLINDA]
La, la, la, la

[OZIANS]
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

[OZIANS]
Save us from the wicked
Every night our voices wail
Save us from this fear and victimhood
We believe in Glinda
With her magic, she'll prevail
She will make it end the way it should
When at last the wicked is defeated by the good
The good
Wicked is defeated by the good
