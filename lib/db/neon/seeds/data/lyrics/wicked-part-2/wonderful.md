[WIZARD]
Take it from a wise old carny
Once folks buy into your blarney
It becomes the thing they'll most hold onto
Once they've swallowed sham and hokum
Facts and logic won't unchoke 'em
They'll go on believing what they want to
Show them exactly what's the score
They'll just believe it even more

"Wonderful"
They called me "Wonderful"
So I said, "Wonderful"
If you insist

"Wonderful"
I will be wonderful

[GLINDA & WIZARD]
Believe me, it's hard to rеsist
'Cause it feels wonderful

[GLINDA]
They think hе's wonderful

[WIZARD]
Hey, look who's wonderful
This corn-fed hick
Who said, "It might be keen
To build a town of green
And a wonderful road of yellow brick"

[WIZARD, spoken]
You know, we could be like a—, like a family
You know, I never really had a family

[ELPHABA, spoken]
Lucky you

[WIZARD, spoken]
That's why I've wanted to give the citizens of Oz everything

[ELPHABA, spoken]
So you lied to them?

[WIZARD]
The truth is not a thing of fact or reason
The truth is just what everyone agrees on

[WIZARD, spoken]
You see, back where I come from, we got a whole lot of people who believe all sorts of things that aren't true
You know what we call it?
History

[WIZARD]
A man's called a traitor or liberator
A rich man's a thief or philanthropist
Is one an invader or noble crusader?
It's all in which label is able to persist
There are precious few at ease with moral ambiguities
So we act as though they don't exist


[GLINDA]
They call him, "Wonderful"

[WIZARD]
So I am wonderful

[GLINDA]
He is so wonderful
It's part of his name

[GLINDA & WIZARD]
And with our help, you can be the same

[GLINDA, spoken]
Elphie, think of what we could do
Together

[GLINDA]
Unlimited
Together, we're unlimited
Together, we'll be the greatest team there's ever been, Elphie

[ELPHABA]
Dreams the way we planned 'em

[GLINDA]
If we work in tandem


[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
There's no fight we cannot win

[WIZARD]
At long, long last, recieve your due

[GLINDA]
Long overdue

[WIZARD]
Elphaba
A celebration throughout Oz that's all to do
With you

[GLINDA & WIZARD]
Wonderful
They'll call you, "Wonderful"

[GLINDA]
Come and be wonderful

[WIZARD]
Trust me, it's fun

[GLINDA]
We will be wonderful

[WIZARD]
You'll make me wonderful

[GLINDA & WIZARD]
Wonderful, wonderful
