[NESSAROSE, spoken]
I want to go back to the way we were at school

[NESSAROSE]
That night at the Ozdust
Boq danced with me there
And it felt like he loved me then
That night, when I felt I was floating on air
I want to feel that again

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
Make me feel that again

[ELPHABA, spoken]
Oh, Nessa, at last

[ELPHABA]
I'd always been unsure I could
But finally, from these powers, something good
Finally something good

[BOQ, spoken]
Nessa, there's something I have to—

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
Look

[BOQ, spoken]
You did this? To make her happy?

[BOQ]
Nessa

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
Yes?

[BOQ]
Uh, Nessa
Surely now I'll matter less to you
And you won't mind my leaving here tonight

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
Lеaving?

[BOQ]
The moment when I rеad
Glinda's going to be wed to Fiyero

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
Glinda?

[BOQ]
Yes, Nessa, that's right
And I've got to go appeal to her
Express the way I feel to her


[BOQ, spoken]
I lost my heart to Glinda the moment I first saw her

[NESSAROSE, spoken]
Lost your heart?
Well, we'll see about that

[BOQ, spoken]
Ah, my heart
It feels like it's, like it's shrinking

[NESSAROSE]
Save him, please, just save him
My poor Boq, my sweet, my brave him
Don't leave me till my sorry life has ceased
Alone and loveless here
With just the girl in the mirror
Just her and me
The Wicked Witch of the East
We deserve each other
