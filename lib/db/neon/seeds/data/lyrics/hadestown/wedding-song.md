[EURYDICE]
Lover, tell me if you can
Who's gonna buy the wedding bands?
Times being what they are
Hard and getting harder all the time

[ORPHEUS]
Lover, when I sing my song
All the rivers'll sing along
And they're gonna break their banks for us
And with their gold, be generous
All a-flashing in the pan, all to fashion for your hand
The river's gonna give us the wedding bands

[EURYDICE]
Lover, tell me, if you're able
Who's gonna lay the wedding table?
Times being what they are
Dark and getting darker all the time

[ORPHEUS]
Lover, when I sing my song
All the trees gonna sing along
And they're gonna bend their branches down
To lay their fruit upon the ground
The almond and the apple
And the sugar from the maple
The trees gonna lay the wedding table

[EURYDICE, spoken]
So when you sing your song
The one you're working on
Spring will come again?

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
Yes

[EURYDICE, spoken]
Why don't you sing it then?

[ORPHEUS]
It isn't finished

[EURYDICE, spoken]
Sing it
You wanna take me home?

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
Yes

[EURYDICE, spoken]
Sing the song


[ORPHEUS]
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

[COMPANY]
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

[EURYDICE, spoken]
How'd you do that?

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
I don't know
The song's not finished though

[EURYDICE, spoken]
Even so, it can do this?

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
I know...

[EURYDICE]
(spoken)
You have to finish it!
(sung)
Lover, tell me, when we're wed
Who's gonna make the wedding bed?
Times being what they are
Hard and getting harder all the time


[ORPHEUS]
Lover, when I sing my song
All the birds gonna sing along
And they'll come flying from all around
To lay their feathers on the ground
And we'll lie down in eiderdown
A pillow 'neath our heads
The birds gonna make the wedding bed

[EURYDICE]
And the trees gonna lay the wedding table

[ORPHEUS]
And the river's gonna give us the wedding bands

[COMPANY]
Ooh
