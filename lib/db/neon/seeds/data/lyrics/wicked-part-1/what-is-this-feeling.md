[GALINDA, spoken]
Dearest, darlingest Momsie and Popsicle

[ELPHABA, spoken]
My dear father

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
There's been some confusion over rooming here at Shiz

[ELPHABA]
But of course, I'll care for Nessa

[GALINDA]
But of course, I'll rise above it

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond, yes
There's been some confusion for, you see, my roommate is

[GALINDA]
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe

[ELPHABA, spoken]
Blonde

[GALINDA]
What is this feeling, so sudden, and new?

[ELPHABA]
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you

[GALINDA]
My pulse is rushing

[ELPHABA]
My head is reeling

[GALINDA]
My face is flushing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
What is this feeling?
Fervid as a flame
Does it have a name?
Yes
Loathing
Unadulterated loathing

[GALINDA]
For your face


[ELPHABA]
Your voice

[GALINDA]
Your clothing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
Let's just say
I loathe it all
Every little trait, however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl
With simple, utter loathing
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure, so strong
Though I do admit, it came on fast
Still, I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing
Loathing you my whole life long

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Dear Galinda, you are just too good
How do you stand it? I don't think I could
She's a terror, she's a Tartar, we don't mean to show a bias
But, Galinda, you're a martyr


[GALINDA]
Well, these things are sent to try us

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Poor Galinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We just want to tell you, we're all on your side
We share your loathing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
What is this feeling, so sudden and new?

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Unadulterated loathing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
For her face, her voice, her clothing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA, SHIZ STUDENTS]
My pulse is rushing, my head is reeling (Let's just say)

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
We loathe it all

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
Oh, what is this feeling?

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Every little trait, however small

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
Does it have a name?

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Makes our very flesh begin to crawl

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
Yes

[ALL]
Ah

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
Loathing

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Loathing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
There's a strange exhilaration

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Loathing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
In such total detestation

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Loathing

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
It's so pure, so strong

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
So strong

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
Though I do admit, it came on fast
Still, I do believe that it can last

[GALINDA & ELPHABA, ALL, SHIZ STUDENTS]
And I will be loathing for forever
Loathing truly deeply
Loathing you (Loathing you)

[GALINDA & ELPHABA]
My whole life long

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
Loathing
Unadulterated loathing

[ELPHABA]
Boo!

[GALINDA]
Ah!
