[OZIAN IN THE CROWD, spoken]
Glinda! Is it true you were her friend?

[GLINDA, spoken]
Well, it depends on what you mean by "friend"
I did know her
That is, our paths did cross
At school

[SHIZ STUDENTS]
O hallowed halls and vine-draped walls
The proudliest sight there is (Sight there is)
When grey and sere our hair hath turned
We shall still revere the lessons learned
In our days at dear old Shiz (Dear old Shiz)
Our days at dear old

[GALINDA]
Old

[SHIZ STUDENTS & GALINDA]
Shiz (Dear old Shiz)
