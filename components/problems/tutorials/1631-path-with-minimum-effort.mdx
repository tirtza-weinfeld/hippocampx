[1631. Path With Minimum Effort](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right of a height grid that minimizes the "effort". - Effort is the single largest height difference between any two adjacent cells on the path.

## [!(ProblemArguments)] Key Arguments

- `heights: list[list[int]]`: 2D list of integers representing the heights of the cells

## [!(ProblemKeyVariables)] Key Variables

- `pq`: Priority queue stores (max_effort_on_path, r, c)
- `resolved`: set to store the positions that have been resolved

## [!(ProblemReturns)] Returns

`int`: minimum effort to reach the bottom-right cell

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1631-path-with-minimum-effort/solution.py"
import heapq

def path_with_minimum_effort(heights: list[list[int]]) -> int:

    R, C = len(heights), len(heights[0])
    pq, resolved = [(0, 0, 0)], set()

    while pq:
        effort, r, c = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if (r, c) in resolved: continue
        if (r, c) == (R - 1, C - 1): return effort
        resolved.add((r, c))

        for nr, nc in [(r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c), (r - 1, c)]:
            if 0 <= nr < R and 0 <= nc < C and (nr, nc) not in resolved:
                neighbor_effort = max(effort, abs(heights[nr][nc] - heights[r][c]))
                heapq.heappush(pq, (neighbor_effort, nr, nc))
