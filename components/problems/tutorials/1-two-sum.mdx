[1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

## [!(ProblemTimeComplexity)] Time Complexity

- $O(n)$
    - where n is the length of the nums array. We iterate through the array once.

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1-two-sum/solution.py"
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:

    seen = {}

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if (x := target - num) in seen:
            return seen[x], i
        seen[num] = i
```
