[1094. Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given **$trips[i] = [numPassengers_i, from_i, to_i]$** and a **car capacity**,     determine if the car ever exceeds its capacity while moving east
    *[19!]The locations  *[2!]$from_i$, $to_i$*  are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's *[2!]initial* location*

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1094-car-pooling/solution.py"
from collections import defaultdict

def car_pooling(trips, capacity):
    location = defaultdict(int)
    for p, s, e in trips:
        location[s] += p
        location[e] -= p

    onboard = 0
    for _, p in sorted(location.items()):
        onboard += p
        if onboard > capacity:
            return False
    return True
```
