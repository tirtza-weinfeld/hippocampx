[2140. Most Points Solving Questions With Brainpower](https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an array of `questions` where `questions[i] = [pointsᵢ, brainpowerᵢ]`, you process from i=0 and at each i choose to either solve (gain `pointsᵢ` and jump `brainpowerᵢ + 1`) or skip (move to `i + 1`). Return the maximum points achievable.

## [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- Paradigm: This is a classic **Longest Path** problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
    - Insight: The maximum score obtainable *from* any question `i` is a fixed value, regardless of past choices. This allows a backward pass from the end of the exam (where the future score is 0), calculating the optimal future score for each question by simply choosing the `max()` of two pre-computed paths: the one from "solving" vs. the one from "skipping".

## [!(ProblemTimeComplexity)] Time Complexity

- O(n)
    - where `n` is the number of questions.

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/2140-solving-questions-with-brainpower/solution.py"
def most_points_solving_questions_with_brainpower(questions: list[list[int]]) -> int:

    memo, n = {}, len(questions)

    def dp(i):
        if i >= n:
            return 0

        if i not in memo:
            memo[i] = max(dp(i + 1), (q:=questions[i])[0] + dp(i + 1 + q[1]))
        return memo[i]

    return dp(0)
