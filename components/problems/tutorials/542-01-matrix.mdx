[542. 01 Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given a binary matrix `mat`, return the distance of the nearest `0` for each cell. The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

## [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- Multi-Source BFS from the Target ðŸŽ¯:
    - Instead of starting a separate BFS from every `1` to find the nearest `0` (which would be slow), this approach inverts the problem. It starts a single, **multi-source BFS from all `0`s simultaneously**. The level of the BFS at which a cell is reached is, by definition, its shortest distance to any `0`. This "start from the answer" strategy is a powerful technique for shortest path problems.

## [!(ProblemTimeComplexity)] Time Complexity

- $O(m * n)$:
    - where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
    - Every cell is enqueued and processed exactly once, making this the optimal solution.

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/542-01-matrix/solution.py"
from collections import deque

def zero_one_matrix(mat: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    dist = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]
    q = deque()
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if mat[i][j] == 0:
                dist[i][j] = 0
                q.append((i, j))

    while q:
        i, j = q.popleft()
        for di, dj in ((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)):
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and dist[ni][nj] < 0:
                dist[ni][nj] = dist[i][j] + 1
                q.append((ni, nj))
    return dist
```
