[84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram)

## [!ProblemDefinition] Definition

Given an array of integers representing the histogram's bar heights where the width of each bar is 1,     return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

## [!ProblemTimeComplexity] Time Complexity

- $O(n)$:
    - Each index is pushed once and popped once, so the total operations across the loop are linear.
    - The inner while doesn't make it $O(nÂ²)$ because every pop is matched to one push.

## [!ProblemKeyExpressions] Key Expressions

- `heights.append(0)`: adds a **right sentinel** bar smaller than all others, forcing the stack to empty and compute all remaining areas at the end (no leftover bars).
- `stack = [-1]`: adds a **left sentinel** index before the array start, so width computation `i - stack[-1] - 1` always works (never empty stack).
- `heights[stack[-1]] > h`: pop while current bar is lower than stack's top
- `width = i - stack[-1] - 1`: We subtract 1 because the bar at stack[-1] is strictly smaller and marks the left boundary, which is excluded from the rectangle
- `heights.pop()`: restore original list

## [!ProblemCodeSnippet] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/84-largest-rectangle-in-histogram/solution.py"
def largestRectangleArea( heights: list[int]) -> int:
    heights.append(0); stack  = [-1]; max_area = 0
    for i, h in enumerate(heights):
        while stack[-1] != -1 and heights[stack[-1]] > h:
            height = heights[stack.pop()]
            width = i - stack[-1] - 1
            max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
        stack.append(i)
    heights.pop()
    return max_area
```
