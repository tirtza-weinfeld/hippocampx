## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an n x n grid of 0s (water) and 1s (land), find the maximum distance from any water cell to the nearest land cell. Return -1 if the grid has only land or only water

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1162-as-far-from-land-as-possible/solution.py"
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxDistance(self, grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:

        n = len(grid)
        q = deque([(r, c) for r in range(n) for c in range(n) if grid[r][c]])

        if not q or len(q) == n * n:
            return -1

        distance = 0
        while q:
            distance += 1
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                (y, x) = q.popleft()
                for dy, dx in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                    if 0 <= (i := y + dy) < n and 0 <= (j := x + dx) < n and not grid[i][j]:
                        grid[i][j] = 1
                        q.append((i, j))
        return distance
