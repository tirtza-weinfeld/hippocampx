[778. Swim in Rising Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/swim-in-rising-water)

## [!ProblemDefinition] Definition

You are given an `N x N` grid of elevations. Find the minimum "time" `t` to travel from `(0, 0)` to `(N-1, N-1)`. You can only move between adjacent cells if their elevation is less than or equal to the time `t`

## [!ProblemArguments] Key Arguments

- `grid: list[list[int]]`: 2D list of integers representing the elevations of the cells

## [!ProblemKeyVariables] Key Variables

- `pq`: Priority queue stores (max_elevation_on_path, r, c)
- `resolved`: set to store the cells for which we have found the minimum time required to reach them

## [!ProblemReturns] Returns

`int`: minimum time to travel from `(0, 0)` to `(N-1, N-1)`

## [!ProblemCodeSnippet] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/778-swim-in-rising-water/solution.py"
import heapq

def swim_in_rising_water(grid: list[list[int]]) -> int:

    n=len(grid)
    pq, resolved = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)], set()

    while pq:
        time, r, c = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if (r, c) in resolved:continue
        if (r, c) == (n - 1, n - 1):return time
        resolved.add((r, c))

        for nr, nc in [(r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c), (r - 1, c)]:
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and (nr, nc) not in resolved:
                bottleneck_time = max(time, grid[nr][nc])
                heapq.heappush(pq, (bottleneck_time, nr, nc))
