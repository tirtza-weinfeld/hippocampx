[76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively,     return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates)     is included in the window. If no such window exists, return an empty string `""`,
    *[19!]solve it in linear time complexity O(m + n)*

## [!(ProblemTimeComplexity)] Time Complexity

- O(m + n)

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/76-minimum-window-substring/solution.py"
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    t_count, have = Counter(t), defaultdict(int)
    letters_needed, min_idx, l = len(t_count), None, 0
    for r, c in enumerate(s):
        have[c] += 1
        if have[c] == t_count[c]:
            letters_needed -= 1
            while letters_needed == 0:
                if not min_idx or r - l + 1 < min_idx[1] - min_idx[0]:
                    min_idx = l, r + 1
                have[s[l]] -= 1
                if have[s[l]] < t_count[s[l]]:
                    letters_needed += 1
                l += 1
    return "" if min_idx == None else s[min_idx[0] : min_idx[1]]
