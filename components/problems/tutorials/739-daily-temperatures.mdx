## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures,
    return an array answer such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the $i^{th}$ day to get a warmer temperature.
    If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

def dailyTemperatures( temperatures: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    stack, wait = [], [0] * len(temperatures)
    for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
        while stack and t > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            wait[d] = i - (d:=stack.pop())
        stack.append(i)
    return wait
