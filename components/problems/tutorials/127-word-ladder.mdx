[127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder)

## [!ProblemDefinition] Definition

Given a `beginWord`, an `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord` such that only one letter is changed at a time and each transformed word exists in the `wordList`.

## [!ProblemIntuition] Intuition

- Bidirectional BFS Meets in the Middle 🤝:
    - This solution uses two  optimizations. First, it **pre-computes all possible generic transformations** (e.g., `h*t`) in a dictionary, allowing for instant lookups of neighboring words instead of generating them on the fly. Second, it performs a **bidirectional BFS**, launching one search from the `beginWord` and another from the `endWord`. By always expanding the smaller of the two frontiers, it drastically reduces the search space. The algorithm finishes when the two searches meet, at which point the shortest path is found.

## [!ProblemTimeComplexity] Time Complexity

- O(N * L):
    - where N is the number of words and L is the length of each word. The dominant operation is the initial pre-computation step to build the `combos` dictionary. The subsequent bidirectional search is typically much faster than this initial setup.

## [!ProblemCodeSnippet] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/127-word-ladder/solution.py"
from collections import defaultdict

def word_ladder(beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: list[str]) -> int:
    if endWord not in wordList:
        return 0

    L = len(beginWord)
    combos: dict[str, list[str]] = defaultdict(list)
    for w in wordList:
        for i in range(L):
            combos[w[:i] + "*" + w[i+1:]].append(w)

    front, back = {beginWord}, {endWord}
    dist_front, dist_back = {beginWord: 1}, {endWord: 1}

    while front and back:
        # expand smaller side to optimize
        if len(front) > len(back):
            front, back = back, front
            dist_front, dist_back = dist_back, dist_front

        next_front = set()
        for word in front:
            for i in range(L):
                for n in combos[word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]]: # Use pre-computed neighbors
                    if n in dist_back:
                        return dist_front[word] + dist_back[n]
                    if n not in dist_front:
                        dist_front[n] = dist_front[word] + 1
                        next_front.add(n)
        front = next_front

    return 0
```
