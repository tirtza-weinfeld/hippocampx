[287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.

## [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- Problem Structure (Why a cycle exists):
        - There are `n+1` indices with values in `{1,...,n}`. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one value repeats.
        - Define `f(i) = nums[i]`. Each index has exactly one outgoing edge, forming a functional graph where a path eventually enters a cycle.
        - The duplicate value is the cycle entrance (the only node with in-degree > 1).

- Deep Dive: Phase 1: Why slow and fast must meet:
        - Let `λ` be the cycle length. Once both enter the cycle, we measure steps `k` relative to the entrance.
        - slow moves 1 step per iteration, fast moves 2 steps.
        - They meet iff their positions differ by a multiple of `λ`:
            - $2k ≡ k (mod λ)  =>  2k - k ≡ 0 (mod λ)  =>  k ≡ 0 (mod λ)$
        - Since the relative gap closes by 1 each step, the smallest positive `k` satisfying this is `k = λ`.
        - Thus, they must meet within at most `λ` steps.

- Deep Dive: Phase 2: Why the meeting point leads to the duplicate:
        - Let `μ` = distance from start to entrance, `λ` = cycle length, and `x` = distance from entrance to the meeting point.
        - Total steps taken by slow at meeting: `t = μ + x`.
        - From Phase 1, we know `t` must be a multiple of `λ`:
            - $t = kλ  =>  μ + x = kλ  =>  μ = kλ - x$
        - This identity shows the distance from the start to the entrance (`μ`) is mathematically equal to the distance from the meeting point back to the entrance (`kλ - x`).
        - If we reset one pointer to the start and move both at speed 1, they will collide exactly at the cycle entrance (the duplicate).
