[841. Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Start at room 0 (unlocked).    `rooms[i]` lists keys found in room `i`;    using keys, can you visit all `n` rooms?    Return true/false.    Constraints: *n=rooms.length*, *2≤n≤1000*, *0≤|rooms[i]|≤1000*, *1≤Σ|rooms[i]|≤3000*, *keys in [0,n), unique per room*.

## [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- Deep Dive:DFS reachability from room 0:
    - Goal: start from room 0 and reach every other room using the keys you find
    - Idea: DFS = “go as deep as possible before backtracking”
        - Each room is a node
        - Each key in that room is an edge to another node
    - Stack: we use a stack to track rooms we can explore next
        - Start with [0] (room 0 is unlocked)
    - Visited: mark rooms we’ve already opened so we don’t revisit them
    - Process:
        - Pop a room from the stack
        - For each key inside, if that room isn’t visited, mark it and push it on the stack
    - Finish: when the stack is empty, we’ve explored every reachable room
    - Check: if all rooms are visited → return True, else False

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/841-keys-and-rooms/solution.py"
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: list[list[int]]) -> bool:
        stack = [0]
        seen = [True] + [False] * (len(rooms) - 1)
        while stack:
            for key in rooms[stack.pop()]:
                if not seen[key]:
                    seen[key] = True
                    stack.append(key)
        return all(seen)
