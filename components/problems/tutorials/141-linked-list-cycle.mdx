[141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given the head of a linked list, return weather it contains a cycle (i.e., traversing via next pointers eventually revisits a node).

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/141-linked-list-cycle/solution.py"
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def linked_list_cycle(head: ListNode | None) -> bool:
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        if (slow := slow.next) == (fast := fast.next.next):
            return True
    return False
```
