[1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given a stick of length n and cut positions, each cut costs the stick's current length.    Find the minimum total cost to make all cuts
    + `[7!]2 <= n <= 10^6` , `[7!]1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)` , `[7!]1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
    + *[8!]All the integers in cuts array are distinct*

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1547-minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/solution.py"
def minCost(n: int, cuts: list[int]) -> int:
    cuts = [0, *sorted(cuts), n]
    memo = {}

    def dp(l: int, r: int) -> int:
        if r - l <= 1:
            return 0
        if (l, r) not in memo:
            memo[l, r] = min(
                dp(l, k) + dp(k, r) + (cuts[r] - cuts[l]) for k in range(l + 1, r)
            )
        return memo[l, r]

    return dp(0, len(cuts) - 1)
