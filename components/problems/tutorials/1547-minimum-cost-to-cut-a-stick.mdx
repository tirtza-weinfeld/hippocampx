[1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given a stick of length n and cut positions, each cut costs the stick's current length.    Find the minimum total cost to make all cuts
    + `[7!]2 <= n <= 10^6` , `[7!]1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)` , `[7!]1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
    + *[8!]All the integers in cuts array are distinct*

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1547-minimum-cost-to-cut-a-stick/solution.py"
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, n: int, cuts: list[int]) -> int:

        cuts = [0] + sorted(cuts) + [n]
        memo = {}

        def dp(l, r):
            if r - l <= 1:
                return 0

            if (key := (l, r)) not in memo:
                memo[key] = (cuts[r] - cuts[l]) + min(
                    dp(l, k) + dp(k, r) for k in range(l + 1, r)
                )
            return memo[key]

        return dp(0, len(cuts) - 1)
