[1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an undirected graph with edges representing traversal probabilities, return the success probability of the path from a `start` to an `end` node with the highest success probability.

## Dijkstra Solution

### [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- We want the path from `start` to `end` with the largest product of edge probabilities:
    - This is equivalent to Dijkstra’s algorithm, replacing *sum of distances* with             *product of probabilities* and switching from a *[2!]min-heap* to a *[2!]max-heap*.

- Deep Dive: Correctness:
        - Each edge weight (probability) *$\in [0, 1]$*.
        - Multiplying by a value *$\leq 1$* never increases the product, so the total probability                   along any path is monotonically non-increasing as the path length grows.
        - This monotonicity guarantees that *once we extract a node with the current                   maximum probability from the heap, no later path can improve it.*
            - same invariant that makes Dijkstra correct for nonnegative edge weights.
            - By contrast, *longest path* problems fail this property because edge weights                 can be positive and cumulative, allowing cycles to increase total weight                 indefinitely (no monotonic bound), making them *NP-hard*.

### [!(ProblemReturns)] Returns

`float`: Maximum probability to reach `end` from `start`, or 0.0 if unreachable.

### [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1514-path-with-maximum-probability/dijkstra.py"
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxProbability(self, n: int, edges: list[list[int]], succProb: list[float], start: int, end: int) -> float:

        adj = defaultdict(list)
        for (u, v), p in zip(edges, succProb):
            adj[u].append((v, p))
            adj[v].append((u, p))

        pq, best = [(-1.0, start)], [0.0] * n
        best[start] = 1.0

        while pq:
            p, u = heappop(pq)
            p = -p
            if u == end:
                return p
            if p < best[u]:
                continue
            for v, w in adj[u]:
                new_p = p * w
                if new_p > best[v]:
                    best[v] = new_p
                    heappush(pq, (-new_p, v))
        return 0.0
```

## Bellman Ford Solution

### [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- Bellman-Ford variant to maximize product of probabilities.
    - Each node tracks the maximum probability to reach it from `start`.

### [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1514-path-with-maximum-probability/bellman-ford.py"
class Solution:
    def maxProbability(self, n: int, edges: list[list[int]], succProb: list[float], start: int, end: int) -> float:
        prob = [0.0] * n
        prob[start] = 1.0

        for _ in range(n - 1):
            updated = False
            for (u, v), p in zip(edges, succProb):
                if prob[u] * p > prob[v]:
                    prob[v] = prob[u] * p
                    updated = True
                if prob[v] * p > prob[u]:
                    prob[u] = prob[v] * p
                    updated = True
            if not updated:
                break

        return prob[end]
```
