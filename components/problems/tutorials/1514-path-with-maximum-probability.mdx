[1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an undirected graph with edges representing traversal probabilities, find the path from a `start` to an `end` node with the highest success probability.

## [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- Bellman-Ford variant to maximize product of probabilities.
    - Each node tracks the maximum probability to reach it from `start`.

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/1514-path-with-maximum-probability/solution.py"
def path_with_maximum_probability(n: int, edges: list[list[int]], succProb: list[float], start: int, end: int) -> float:
    prob = [0.0] * n
    prob[start] = 1.0

    for _ in range(n - 1):
        updated = False
        for (u, v), p in zip(edges, succProb):
            if prob[u] * p > prob[v]:
                prob[v] = prob[u] * p
                updated = True
            if prob[v] * p > prob[u]:
                prob[u] = prob[v] * p
                updated = True
        if not updated:
            break

    return prob[end]
```
