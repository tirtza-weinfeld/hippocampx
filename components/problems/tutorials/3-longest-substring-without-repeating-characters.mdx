[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)

## [!ProblemDefinition] Definition

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## [!ProblemTimeComplexity] Time Complexity

- $O(n)$:
    - where n is the length of the string. Each character is visited once by the right pointer, and the left pointer only moves forward, so the sliding window expands and contracts at most n times total.

## [!ProblemArguments] Key Arguments

- `s: str`: Input string to analyze

## [!ProblemKeyExpressions] Key Expressions

- `l = max(mp[c] + 1, l)`: ensures that l does not move backward in cases where the last occurrence of s[r] was before l.

## [!ProblemReturns] Returns

`int`: Length of the longest substring without repeating characters

## [!ProblemCodeSnippet] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/3-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/solution.py"
def longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(s: str) -> int:
    mp, l, max_length = {}, 0, 0
    for r, c in enumerate(s):
        if c in mp:
            l = max(mp[c] + 1, l)
        mp[c] = r
        max_length = max(max_length, r - l + 1)
    return max_length
```
