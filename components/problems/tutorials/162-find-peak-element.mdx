[162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an array nums where adjacent elements are unequal, find any index i such that `nums[i+1] < nums[i] > nums[i-1]` .
    treating out-of-bounds neighbors as $-\infty$. You must return any such peak index in $O(\log n)$ time.

## [!(ProblemIntuition)] Intuition

- Treat the array as a landscape.
    - If `nums[m] < nums[m+1]`, you are going uphill, so a peak must exist to the right.
    - If `nums[m] > nums[m+1]`, you are going downhill (or already at a peak), so a peak exists at m or to the left.

- Each comparison lets us discard half the array while preserving at least one guaranteed peak (since the ends are -∞).
- Repeating this converges to a peak index in O(log n).

## [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/162-find-peak-element/solution.py"
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[m] < nums[m + 1]:
                l = m + 1
            else:
                r = m
        return l
```
