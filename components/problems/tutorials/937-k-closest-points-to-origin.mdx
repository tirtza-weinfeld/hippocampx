[937. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/)

## [!(ProblemDefinition)] Definition

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).
    You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

```python meta="source=problems/937-k-closest-points-to-origin/heap.py"
import heapq

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: list[list[int]], k: int) -> list[list[int]]:
        d = [(x*x + y*y, (x,y)) for x, y in points]
        heapq.heapify(d)
        return [heapq.heappop(d)[1] for _ in range(k)]

### [!(ProblemCodeSnippet)] Code Snippet

```python meta="source=problems/937-k-closest-points-to-origin/binary-search.py"
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: list[list[int]], k: int) -> list[list[int]]:

        distance = [x*x + y*y for x, y in points]

        lo, hi = 0, max(distance)
        while lo < hi:
            mid = (lo + hi) // 2
            if sum(d <= mid for d in distance) >= k:
                hi = mid
            else:
                lo = mid + 1

        res = [pt for pt, d in zip(points, distance) if d <= lo]
        return res[:k]
