Dfs with early exit on mismatch
    Start dfs from each cell
    At each step:
        Check bounds and character match
        Mark visited cell with a temp symbol (e.g. #)
        Try 4 directions (no revisiting)
        Restore cell after backtracking
        Stop early if the full word is matched.
