- This is essentially *Kadane's Algorithm*:
    - Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is an $O(n)$ dynamic programming method for finding the maximum subarray sum in a list of integers (contiguous elements).
    - Core idea:
        - Keep track of the best sum ending at the current position
        - If adding the current number hurts the sum, start fresh from the current number
        - Track the overall maximum as you go

- Deep Dive: SRT BOT:
        - Subproblem: `dp(i) = max(nums[i], nums[i] + dp(i-1))`
        - Relate: `dp(i)` depends only on `dp(i-1)`
        - Topological order: increasing `i`
        - Base case: `dp(0) = nums[0]`
        - Original problem: `max(dp(i))` over all i
