- Pad with 1's at both ends so edges are uniform.            **For any interval `(i, j)`, choose the last balloon `k` to pop**: *its neighbors are then `i` and `j`*,             giving coins `nums[i]*nums[k]*nums[j]`             + optimal coins from the two subintervals `dp(i,k)` and `dp(k,j)`             Memoize intervals; empty/sliver intervals give 0. (Classic interval DP, ~O(nÂ³).)
