- Water trapped above each bar depends on the smaller of the tallest walls to its left and right:
    - By keeping two pointers—one at each end—and always moving the smaller side inward, we ensure that the limiting wall for that side is already known.
        - When the left bar is shorter, we can safely compute water at left using lmax (its tallest left wall), because a taller or equal wall must exist on the right.
        - Symmetrically, when the right bar is shorter, we compute water using rmax.
    - This invariant guarantees every position’s water level is computed exactly once in O(n) time and O(1) space
