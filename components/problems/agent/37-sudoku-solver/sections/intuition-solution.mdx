MRV (Minimum Remaining Values):
    Candidates per cell: `{'1'..'9'} − (row ∪ col ∪ box)`.
    MRV: pick the empty cell with the fewest candidates to prune hardest.
    Place a digit tentatively, update sets, recurse; undo on failure (backtrack).
    If any cell has 0 candidates, the branch is impossible → backtrack immediately.
