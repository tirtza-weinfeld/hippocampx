- Paradigm: This is a classic **Unbounded Knapsack** counting problem.

- Insight: To count *combinations* without overcounting *permutations* (`1+2` vs `2+1`), the DP imposes a strict processing order on the coins. This ensures that combinations are always built in the same sequence (e.g., using smaller denomination coins before larger ones), elegantly eliminating duplicates.
