- Hash Map as a Visited Set & Node Cache 🗺️
    - The key to traversing a potentially cyclic graph is a `visited` set. Here, the `cloned` dictionary serves a dual purpose. It acts as both a **`visited` set** (by checking `if n not in cloned`) and a **cache** that maps an original node to its clone. This ensures each node is cloned exactly once and prevents getting stuck in an infinite loop.
