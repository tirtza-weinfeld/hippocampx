- In a circle, first and last houses are adjacent — we cannot rob both
    - ⇒ Split into two linear cases:
        - exclude last house → `rob(houses[:-1])`
        - exclude first house → `rob(houses[1:])`
    - Take the better of the two.

- Base case:
        - if only one house, rob it directly.
