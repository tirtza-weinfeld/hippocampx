O(n log k):
    Deep Dive: one sift (faster constant) vs push+pop
        heappush does a sift-up → O(log k)
        heappop does a sift-down → O(log k)
        total ≈ 2 x O(log k) operations
        heapreplace does one sift operation, not two
        removes root, places new element, and does only one sift-down → O(log k)
        So same asymptotic complexity, but half the work, fewer comparisons and function calls → faster constant factor.
