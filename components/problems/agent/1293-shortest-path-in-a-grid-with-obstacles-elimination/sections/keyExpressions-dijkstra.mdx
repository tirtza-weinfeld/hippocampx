- `heapq.heappush(pq, (steps + 1, nr, nc, new_k))`: The priority is simply the new step count.No heuristic is added, which is the only difference from the A* implementation.
    'heapq.heappop(pq)': Pop the path with the lowest g_cost (steps) so far
    'k_rem < max_k[r][c]': Prune paths that are suboptimal for a given cell
