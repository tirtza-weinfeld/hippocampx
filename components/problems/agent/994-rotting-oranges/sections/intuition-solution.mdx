- Multi-Source BFS üçä:
    - The key is to initialize the queue with the coordinates of *all* initially rotten oranges. The BFS then naturally simulates the rotting process in parallel from all sources. Each "level" of the BFS corresponds to one minute passing. Finally, you must check if any `fresh_oranges` remain to handle cases where some are unreachable.
