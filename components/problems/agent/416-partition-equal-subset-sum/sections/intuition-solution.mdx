- This is the **0/1 Knapsack** decision problem in disguise:
    - The problem transforms from partitioning an array into a simpler question:             can a subset of "items" (`nums`) perfectly fill a "knapsack" with capacity `total_sum // 2`?             Each item's weight is equal to its value.
