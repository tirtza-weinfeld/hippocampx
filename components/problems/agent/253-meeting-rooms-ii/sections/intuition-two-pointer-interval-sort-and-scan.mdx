1. Sort all *start times* and all *end times*

2. For each start time:
        - if it is earlier than the earliest end time we haven't used yet,                no room has freed -> take a new room.
        - otherwise, advance the end pointer -> reuse that freed room

- `rooms` becomes the maximum number of simultaneous meetings
