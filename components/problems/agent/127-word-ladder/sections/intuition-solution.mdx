- Bidirectional BFS Meets in the Middle ü§ù:
    - This solution uses two  optimizations. First, it **pre-computes all possible generic transformations** (e.g., `h*t`) in a dictionary, allowing for instant lookups of neighboring words instead of generating them on the fly. Second, it performs a **bidirectional BFS**, launching one search from the `beginWord` and another from the `endWord`. By always expanding the smaller of the two frontiers, it drastically reduces the search space. The algorithm finishes when the two searches meet, at which point the shortest path is found.
