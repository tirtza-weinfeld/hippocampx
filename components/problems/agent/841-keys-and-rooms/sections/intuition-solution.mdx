- Deep Dive:DFS reachability from room 0:
    - Goal: start from room 0 and reach every other room using the keys you find
    - Idea: DFS = “go as deep as possible before backtracking”
        - Each room is a node
        - Each key in that room is an edge to another node
    - Stack: we use a stack to track rooms we can explore next
        - Start with [0] (room 0 is unlocked)
    - Visited: mark rooms we’ve already opened so we don’t revisit them
    - Process:
        - Pop a room from the stack
        - For each key inside, if that room isn’t visited, mark it and push it on the stack
    - Finish: when the stack is empty, we’ve explored every reachable room
    - Check: if all rooms are visited → return True, else False
