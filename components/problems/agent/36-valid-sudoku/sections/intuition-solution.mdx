Cube index and think locally
    **cube_index := **[pink!](r // 3) * 3** + **[purple!](c // 3)**** treats the 9×9 board as a 3×3 grid of 3×3 boxes:
        `[pink!]r//3` gives which *[pink!]box-row* (0,1,2) you're in
        `[purple!]c//3` gives which *[purple!]box-column* (0,1,2)
        multiplying the *[pink!]box-row* by *[pink!]3* and adding the *[purple!]box-column* yields a unique index 0–8 for each 3×3 cube.
