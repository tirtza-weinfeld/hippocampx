- Minimax:
    - *Paradigm*: This is a classic *impartial game* solved using the *Minimax* principle on game states.
    - *Insight*: A position is defined as *winning* if you can make *any* move to a position that you know is *losing* for your opponent. The DP builds this win/loss classification for every number of stones up to `n`, starting from the base case that 0 stones is a losing position.
