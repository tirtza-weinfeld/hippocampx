- `node = node.setdefault(c, {})`: create a new node for the character if it doesn't exist
- `if "$" in node`: if the current node is the end of a word
- `res.append(node.pop("$"))`: add the word to the result list and remove the "$" key to prevent duplicates
- `if not node`: prune the trie to remove dead branches.
- `[dfs`: .. Launch DFS from every cell that matches any trie root key
- `board[i][j] = "#"`: Mark as visited
