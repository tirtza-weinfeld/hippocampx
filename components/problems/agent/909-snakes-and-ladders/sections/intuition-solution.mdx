- Flatten the Board First ðŸŽ²
    - The key insight here is to **pre-process the 2D `board` into a 1D `flat_board` list**. This powerful first step handles all the complex Boustrophedonical logic upfront. By doing this, the BFS loop becomes exceptionally clean and avoids the need for a coordinate conversion function. The search can then operate on a simple 1D array, treating the board as the simple, linear graph it truly represents.
