- Each bar can form a rectangle where its height is the limiting factor:
    - That rectangle extends until a strictly shorter bar appears on either side.
    - Instead of searching both directions explicitly, we discover these bounds on the fly:
        - when a shorter bar appears at `r`, every taller bar popped from the stack
        - now knows its right boundary (`r`) and its left boundary (`l = stack.pop()`).

- Deep Dive: Walkthrough:
    - Append `0` so every bar eventually meets a shorter right neighbor
    - Keep *[3!]indices* in strictly increasing heights (stack starts *[3!][-1]*)
    - For each `r, h`: while top is taller, pop `l` and compute area = `heights[l] * (r - stack[-1] - 1)`
    - Push `r`; remove the sentinel; return best
