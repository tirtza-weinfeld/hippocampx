- Find, Count, and Sink 🏝️
    - The strategy is to scan every cell of the grid. If an unvisited piece of land (`1`) is found, you've discovered a new island, so you increment the `islands` counter. Then, immediately launch a BFS from that cell to find and "sink" all connected parts of that same island by changing their value to `0`. This modification of the grid ensures each island group is counted exactly once.
