- `g[b].append(a)`: add edge `b â†’ a`
    'indeg[a] += 1':    a has one more incoming edge
    'deque(i for i, d in enumerate(indeg) if d == 0)' : Initialize queue with all courses having no prerequisites
    'u = q.popleft()' : take a course with no remaining prereqs
    'taken += 1' : increment the counter for how many courses we've "completed"
    'for v in g[u]' : for each course unlocked by u
    'indeg[v] -= 1' : one prerequisite is now satisfied
    'if indeg[v] == 0' : if no prereqs left
    'q.append(v)' : course is now ready to take
    'taken == n' : If we managed to take all n courses, there was no cycle
    'while q' : Process courses in BFS order
