1. **Model**
    - Each course = a node.
    - Each prerequisite `[a, b]` = a directed edge `b → a` (“b before a”).

2. **Goal**
    - Can we take all courses = does the graph have **no cycle**?
    - If a cycle exists, you’ll never get a course with indegree 0 again.

3. **Idea (Kahn’s algorithm)**
    - Compute **indegree** for each node (how many prereqs it has)
    - Put all nodes with indegree 0 into a queue (they’re ready)
    - While queue not empty:
        - Pop one → mark as taken
        - For each neighbor (course unlocked by it), decrement indegree
        - If indegree becomes 0 → enqueue it
    - If you’ve taken all courses → no cycle → return True
    - Otherwise → cycle → return False
