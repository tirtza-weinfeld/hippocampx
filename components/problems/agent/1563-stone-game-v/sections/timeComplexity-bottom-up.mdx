- $O(n^{2})$:
    - Because each subarray `i..j` is processed once and the middle pointer `mid` moves **monotonically** (never resets for a fixed `j`), every index is advanced at most $O(1)$ times per outer loop.
    - Thus the total work is roughly proportional to the number of `(i, j)` pairs, giving **$O(n²)$** time and **$O(n²)$** space (for `dp` and `mx`).
