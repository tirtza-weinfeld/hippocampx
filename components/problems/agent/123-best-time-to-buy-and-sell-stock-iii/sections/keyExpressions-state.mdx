- `hold1 = hold2 = float("-inf")`: money you'd have if holding first stock
- `sell1 = sell2 = 0`: money you'd have if not holding first stock
- `hold1 = max(hold1, -p)`: buy first stock
- `sell1 = max(sell1, hold1 + p)`: sell first stock
- `hold2 = max(hold2, sell1 - p)`: buy second stock
- `sell2 = max(sell2, hold2 + p)`: sell second stock
