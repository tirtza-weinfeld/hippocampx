- Deep Dive: 2D to 1D:
        - In the 2D DP table, each cell depends only on its top and left neighbors:
        - `dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
        - That means to compute row i, you only need:
            - the current row's left value (`dp[i][j-1]`), and
            - the previous row's value at the same column (`dp[i-1][j]`).
        - So you can compress the table into one list of length c (number of columns):
            - `dp[j]` keeps the current min path sum at column j (effectively `dp[i][j]`),
            - `dp[j-1]` is the left cell,
            - and as you move row by row, `dp[j]` from the previous iteration serves as the top cell.
