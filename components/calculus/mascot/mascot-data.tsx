    definition: "How quickly one quantity changes with respect to another quantity.",
    detailedExplanation:
      "Rate of change measures how fast something is changing. In calculus, we often look at instantaneous rates of change, which is what derivatives give us.",
    formula: "Average rate = Œîy/Œîx, Instantaneous rate = dy/dx",
    example:
      "If a car's position is s(t) = t¬≤, then its velocity (rate of change of position) is s'(t) = 2t. At t = 3 seconds, the car is moving at 6 units per second.",

    definition: "The rule that says the derivative of x‚Åø is n¬∑x‚Åø‚Åª¬π.",
    detailedExplanation:
      "The Power Rule is the most fundamental differentiation rule. It makes finding derivatives of polynomial functions incredibly easy - just multiply by the exponent and reduce the exponent by 1.",
    formula: "If f(x) = x‚Åø, then f'(x) = n¬∑x‚Åø‚Åª¬π",
    example: "d/dx(x¬≥) = 3x¬≤, d/dx(x‚Åµ) = 5x‚Å¥, d/dx(x) = 1, d/dx(constant) = 0",

    definition: "The rule for finding the derivative of composite functions.",
    detailedExplanation:
      "When you have a function inside another function (like f(g(x))), the Chain Rule helps you find the derivative. It's like peeling an onion - you work from the outside in.",
    formula: "If y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) ¬∑ g'(x)",
    example: "For y = (2x + 1)¬≥: outer function is u¬≥, inner is 2x + 1. dy/dx = 3(2x + 1)¬≤ ¬∑ 2 = 6(2x + 1)¬≤",

    definition: "The area under a curve, which can represent total change or accumulation.",
    detailedExplanation:
      "Integration is the opposite of differentiation. While derivatives show rates of change, integrals show total accumulation. Think of it as adding up all the little pieces under a curve.",
    formula: "‚à´ f(x) dx = F(x) + C, where F'(x) = f(x)",
    example:
      "‚à´ 2x dx = x¬≤ + C. This means the area under the curve y = 2x from 0 to some point gives you x¬≤ (plus a constant).",

    formula: "If F'(x) = f(x), then F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x)",

    formula: "Find critical points where f'(x) = 0, then use second derivative test",
    example:
      "To maximize the area of a rectangle with perimeter 20: A = x(10-x), A' = 10-2x. Setting A' = 0 gives x = 5, so the square 5√ó5 has maximum area.",
